<h2>TO THE<br />
RIGHT HONOURABLE CHARLES MONTAGUE,<br />
ONE OF THE LORDS OF THE TREASURY.</h2>
<p>Sir,&mdash;I heartily wish this play were as perfect as I
intended it, that it might be more worthy your acceptance, and
that my dedication of it to you might be more becoming that
honour and esteem which I, with everybody who is so fortunate as
to know you, have for you.&nbsp; It had your countenance when yet
unknown; and now it is made public, it wants your protection.</p>
<p>I would not have anybody imagine that I think this play
without its faults, for I am conscious of several.&nbsp; I
confess I designed (whatever vanity or ambition occasioned that
design) to have written a true and regular comedy, but I found it
an undertaking which put me in mind of <i>Sudet multum</i>,
<i>frustraque laboret ausus idem</i>.&nbsp; And now, to make
amends for the vanity of such a design, I do confess both the
attempt and the imperfect performance.&nbsp; Yet I must take the
boldness to say I have not miscarried in the whole, for the
mechanical part of it is regular.&nbsp; That I may say with as
little vanity as a builder may say he has built a house according
to the model laid down before him, or a gardener that he has set
his flowers in a knot of such or such a figure.&nbsp; I designed
the moral first, and to that moral I invented the fable, and do
not know that I have borrowed one hint of it anywhere.&nbsp; I
made the plot as strong as I could because it was single, and I
made it single because I would avoid confusion, and was resolved
to preserve the three unities of the drama.&nbsp; Sir, this
discourse is very impertinent to you, whose judgment much better
can discern the faults than I can excuse them; and whose good
nature, like that of a lover, will find out those hidden beauties
(if there are any such) which it would be great immodesty for me
to discover.&nbsp; I think I don&rsquo;t speak improperly when I
call you a <i>lover</i> of poetry; for it is very well known she
has been a very kind mistress to you: she has not denied you the
last favour, and she has been fruitful to you in a most beautiful
issue.&nbsp; If I break off abruptly here, I hope everybody will
understand that it is to avoid a commendation which, as it is
your due, would be most easy for me to pay, and too troublesome
for you to receive.</p>
<p>I have since the acting of this play harkened after the
objections which have been made to it, for I was conscious where
a true critic might have put me upon my defence.&nbsp; I was
prepared for the attack, and am pretty confident I could have
vindicated some parts and excused others; and where there were
any plain miscarriages, I would most ingenuously have confessed
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; But I have not heard anything said sufficient to
provoke an answer.&nbsp; That which looks most like an objection
does not relate in particular to this play, but to all or most
that ever have been written, and that is soliloquy.&nbsp;
Therefore I will answer it, not only for my own sake, but to save
others the trouble, to whom it may hereafter be objected.</p>
<p>I grant that for a man to talk to himself appears absurd and
unnatural, and indeed it is so in most cases; but the
circumstances which may attend the occasion make great
alteration.&nbsp; It oftentimes happens to a man to have designs
which require him to himself, and in their nature cannot admit of
a confidant.&nbsp; Such for certain is all villainy, and other
less mischievous intentions may be very improper to be
communicated to a second person.&nbsp; In such a case, therefore,
the audience must observe whether the person upon the stage takes
any notice of them at all or no.&nbsp; For if he supposes any one
to be by when he talks to himself, it is monstrous and ridiculous
to the last degree.&nbsp; Nay, not only in this case, but in any
part of a play, if there is expressed any knowledge of an
audience, it is insufferable.&nbsp; But otherwise, when a man in
soliloquy reasons with himself, and <i>pro&rsquo;s</i> and
<i>con&rsquo;s</i>, and weighs all his designs, we ought not to
imagine that this man either talks to us or to himself; he is
only thinking, and thinking such matter as were inexcusable folly
in him to speak.&nbsp; But because we are concealed spectators of
the plot in agitation, and the poet finds it necessary to let us
know the whole mystery of his contrivance, he is willing to
inform us of this person&rsquo;s thoughts; and to that end is
forced to make use of the expedient of speech, no other better
way being yet invented for the communication of thought.</p>
<p>Another very wrong objection has been made by some who have
not taken leisure to distinguish the characters.&nbsp; The hero
of the play, as they are pleased to call him (meaning Mellefont),
is a gull, and made a fool, and cheated.&nbsp; Is every man a
gull and a fool that is deceived?&nbsp; At that rate I&rsquo;m
afraid the two classes of men will be reduced to one, and the
knaves themselves be at a loss to justify their title.&nbsp; But
if an open-hearted honest man, who has an entire confidence in
one whom he takes to be his friend, and whom he has obliged to be
so, and who, to confirm him in his opinion, in all appearance and
upon several trials has been so: if this man be deceived by the
treachery of the other, must he of necessity commence fool
immediately, only because the other has proved a villain?&nbsp;
Ay, but there was caution given to Mellefont in the first act by
his friend Careless.&nbsp; Of what nature was that caution?&nbsp;
Only to give the audience some light into the character of
Maskwell before his appearance, and not to convince Mellefont of
his treachery; for that was more than Careless was then able to
do: he never knew Maskwell guilty of any villainy; he was only a
sort of man which he did not like.&nbsp; As for his suspecting
his familiarity with my Lady Touchwood, let &rsquo;em examine the
answer that Mellefont makes him, and compare it with the conduct
of Maskwell&rsquo;s character through the play.</p>
<p>I would beg &rsquo;em again to look into the character of
Maskwell before they accuse Mellefont of weakness for being
deceived by him.&nbsp; For upon summing up the enquiry into this
objection, it may be found they have mistaken cunning in one
character for folly in another.</p>
<p>But there is one thing at which I am more concerned than all
the false criticisms that are made upon me, and that is, some of
the ladies are offended.&nbsp; I am heartily sorry for it, for I
declare I would rather disoblige all the critics in the world
than one of the fair sex.&nbsp; They are concerned that I have
represented some women vicious and affected.&nbsp; How can I help
it?&nbsp; It is the business of a comic poet to paint the vices
and follies of humankind; and there are but two sexes, male and
female, <i>men</i> and <i>women</i>, which have a title to
humanity, and if I leave one half of them out, the work will be
imperfect.&nbsp; I should be very glad of an opportunity to make
my compliment to those ladies who are offended; but they can no
more expect it in a comedy than to be tickled by a surgeon when
he&rsquo;s letting &rsquo;em blood.&nbsp; They who are virtuous
or discreet should not be offended, for such characters as these
distinguish <i>them</i>, and make their beauties more shining and
observed; and they who are of the other kind may nevertheless
pass for such, by seeming not to be displeased or touched with
the satire of this <i>comedy</i>.&nbsp; Thus have they also
wrongfully accused me of doing them a prejudice, when I have in
reality done them a service.</p>
<p>You will pardon me, sir, for the freedom I take of making
answers to other people in an epistle which ought wholly to be
sacred to you; but since I intend the play to be so too, I hope I
may take the more liberty of justifying it where it is in the
right.</p>
<p>I must now, sir, declare to the world how kind you have been
to my endeavours; for in regard of what was well meant, you have
excused what was ill performed.&nbsp; I beg you would continue
the same method in your acceptance of this dedication.&nbsp; I
know no other way of making a return to that humanity you shewed,
in protecting an infant, but by enrolling it in your service, now
that it is of age and come into the world.&nbsp; Therefore be
pleased to accept of this as an acknowledgment of the favour you
have shewn me, and an earnest of the real service and gratitude
of,</p>
<p>Sir, your most obliged, humble servant,</p>

<h2>TO MY DEAR FRIEND MR. CONGREVE,<br />
ON HIS COMEDY CALLED<br />
THE DOUBLE-DEALER.</h2>
<p>Well then, the promised hour is come at last;<br />
The present age of wit obscures the past.<br />
Strong were our sires; and as they fought they writ,<br />
Conqu&rsquo;ring with force of arms and dint of wit.<br />
Theirs was the giant race, before the flood;<br />
And thus, when Charles returned, our empire stood.<br />
Like Janus he the stubborn soil manured,<br />
With rules of husbandry the rankness cured,<br />
Tamed us to manners, when the stage was rude,<br />
And boist&rsquo;rous English wit with art indued.<br />
Our age was cultivated thus at length;<br />
But what we gained in skill we lost in strength.<br />
Our builders were with want of genius curst;<br />
The second temple was not like the first:<br />
Till you, the best Vitruvius, come at length,<br />
Our beauties equal, but excel our strength.<br />
Firm Doric pillars found your solid base,<br />
The fair Corinthian crowns the higher space;<br />
Thus all below is strength, and all above is grace.<br />
In easy dialogue is Fletcher&rsquo;s praise:<br />
He moved the mind, but had no power to raise.<br />
Great Johnson did by strength of judgment please<br />
Yet doubling Fletcher&rsquo;s force, he wants ease.<br />
In diff&rsquo;ring talents both adorned their age;<br />
One for the study, t&rsquo;other for the stage.<br />
But both to Congreve justly shall submit,<br />
One matched in judgment, both o&rsquo;er-matched in wit.<br />
In him all beauties of this age we see,<br />
Etherege his courtship, Southern&rsquo;s purity,<br />
The satire, wit, and strength of manly Wycherly.<br />
All this in blooming youth you have achieved,<br />
Nor are your foiled contemporaries grieved;<br />
So much the sweetness of your manners move,<br />
We cannot envy you, because we love.<br />
Fabius might joy in Scipio, when he saw<br />
A beardless consul made against the law,<br />
And join his suffrage to the votes of Rome;<br />
Though he with Hannibal was overcome.<br />
Thus old Romano bowed to Raphael&rsquo;s fame,<br />
And scholar to the youth he taught became.</p>
<p>O that your brows my laurel had sustained,<br />
Well had I been deposed if you had reigned!<br />
The father had descended for the son,<br />
For only you are lineal to the throne.<br />
Thus when the state one Edward did depose,<br />
A greater Edward in his room arose.<br />
But now, not I, but poetry is cursed;<br />
For Tom the Second reigns like Tom the First.<br />
But let &rsquo;em not mistake my patron&rsquo;s part,<br />
Nor call his charity their own desert.<br />
Yet this I prophesy: Thou shalt be seen<br />
(Though with some short parenthesis between)<br />
High on the throne of wit; and seated there,<br />
Not mine (that&rsquo;s little) but thy laurel wear.<br />
Thy first attempt an early promise made;<br />
That early promise this has more than paid.<br />
So bold, yet so judiciously you dare,<br />
That your least praise is to be regular.<br />
Time, place, and action may with pains be wrought,<br />
But genius must be born, and never can be taught.<br />
This is your portion, this your native store,<br />
Heav&rsquo;n, that but once was prodigal before,<br />
To Shakespeare gave as much; she could not give him more.</p>
<p>Maintain your post: that&rsquo;s all the fame you need;<br />
For &rsquo;tis impossible you should proceed.<br />
Already I am worn with cares and age,<br />
And just abandoning th&rsquo; ungrateful stage:<br />
Unprofitably kept at heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s expense,<br />
I live a rent-charge on his providence.<br />
But you, whom every muse and grace adorn,<br />
Whom I foresee to better fortune born,<br />
Be kind to my remains; and oh, defend,<br />
Against your judgment, your departed friend!<br />
Let not th&rsquo; insulting foe my fame pursue;<br />
But shade those laurels which descend to you:<br />
And take for tribute what these lines express:<br />
You merit more; nor could my love do less.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">JOHN DRYDEN.</p>
<h2>PROLOGUE<br />
Spoken by <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bracegirdle</span>.</h2>
<p>Moors have this way (as story tells) to know<br />
Whether their brats are truly got or no;<br />
Into the sea the new-born babe is thrown,<br />
There, as instinct directs, to swim or drown.<br />
A barbarous device, to try if spouse<br />
Has kept religiously her nuptial vows.</p>
<p>Such are the trials poets make of plays,<br />
Only they trust to more inconstant seas;<br />
So does our author, this his child commit<br />
To the tempestuous mercy of the pit,<br />
To know if it be truly born of wit.</p>
<p>Critics avaunt, for you are fish of prey,<br />
And feed, like sharks, upon an infant play.<br />
Be ev&rsquo;ry monster of the deep away;<br />
Let&rsquo;s have a fair trial and a clear sea.</p>
<p>Let nature work, and do not damn too soon,<br />
For life will struggle long e&rsquo;er it sink down:<br />
And will at least rise thrice before it drown.<br />
Let us consider, had it been our fate,<br />
Thus hardly to be proved legitimate:<br />
I will not say, we&rsquo;d all in danger been,<br />
Were each to suffer for his mother&rsquo;s sin:<br />
But by my troth I cannot avoid thinking,<br />
How nearly some good men might have &rsquo;scaped sinking.<br />
But, heav&rsquo;n be praised, this custom is confined<br />
Alone to th&rsquo; offspring of the muses kind:<br />
Our Christian cuckolds are more bent to pity;<br />
I know not one Moor-husband in the city.<br />
I&rsquo; th&rsquo; good man&rsquo;s arms the chopping bastard
thrives,<br />
For he thinks all his own that is his wives&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Whatever fate is for this play designed,<br />
The poet&rsquo;s sure he shall some comfort find:<br />
For if his muse has played him false, the worst<br />
That can befall him, is, to be divorced:<br />
You husbands judge, if that be to be cursed.</p>

<h2>ACT I.</h2>
<h3>SCENE I.</h3>
<p><i>A gallery in the Lord Touchwood&rsquo;s home</i>, <i>with
chambers adjoining</i>.</p>
<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Careless</span>, <i>crossing
the stage</i>, <i>with his hat</i>, <i>gloves</i>, <i>and sword
in his hands</i>; <i>as just risen from table</i>: <span
class="smcap">Mellefont</span> <i>following him</i>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Ned, Ned, whither so fast?&nbsp; What, turned
flincher!&nbsp; Why, you wo&rsquo; not leave us?</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Where are the women?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m weary of
guzzling, and begin to think them the better company.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Then thy reason staggers, and thou&rsquo;rt almost
drunk.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; No, faith, but your fools grow noisy; and if a man
must endure the noise of words without sense, I think the women
have more musical voices, and become nonsense better.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Why, they are at the end of the gallery; retired to
their tea and scandal, according to their ancient custom, after
dinner.&nbsp; But I made a pretence to follow you, because I had
something to say to you in private, and I am not like to have
many opportunities this evening.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; And here&rsquo;s this coxcomb most critically come
to interrupt you.</p>
<h3>SCENE II.</h3>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Brisk</span>.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Boys, boys, lads, where are you?&nbsp; What, do
you give ground?&nbsp; Mortgage for a bottle, ha?&nbsp; Careless,
this is your trick; you&rsquo;re always spoiling company by
leaving it.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; And thou art always spoiling company by coming in
o&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Pooh, ha, ha, ha, I know you envy me.&nbsp;
Spite, proud spite, by the gods! and burning envy.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll be judged by Mellefont here, who gives and takes
raillery better than you or I.&nbsp; Pshaw, man, when I say you
spoil company by leaving it, I mean you leave nobody for the
company to laugh at.&nbsp; I think there I was with you.&nbsp;
Ha, Mellefont?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; O&rsquo; my word, Brisk, that was a home thrust;
you have silenced him.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Oh, my dear Mellefont, let me perish if thou art
not the soul of conversation, the very essence of wit and spirit
of wine.&nbsp; The deuce take me if there were three good things
said, or one understood, since thy amputation from the body of
our society.&nbsp; He, I think that&rsquo;s pretty and
metaphorical enough; i&rsquo;gad I could not have said it out of
thy company.&nbsp; Careless, ha?</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Hum, ay, what is&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; <i>O mon c&oelig;ur</i>!&nbsp; What
is&rsquo;t!&nbsp; Nay, gad, I&rsquo;ll punish you for want of
apprehension.&nbsp; The deuce take me if I tell you.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; No, no, hang him, he has no taste.&nbsp; But, dear
Brisk, excuse me, I have a little business.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Prithee get thee gone; thou seest we are
serious.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll come immediately, if you&rsquo;ll but
go in and keep up good humour and sense in the company.&nbsp;
Prithee do, they&rsquo;ll fall asleep else.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; I&rsquo;gad, so they will.&nbsp; Well, I will, I
will; gad, you shall command me from the Zenith to the
Nadir.&nbsp; But the deuce take me if I say a good thing till you
come.&nbsp; But prithee, dear rogue, make haste, prithee make
haste, I shall burst else.&nbsp; And yonder your uncle, my Lord
Touchwood, swears he&rsquo;ll disinherit you, and Sir Paul Plyant
threatens to disclaim you for a son-in-law, and my Lord Froth
won&rsquo;t dance at your wedding to-morrow; nor, the deuce take
me, I won&rsquo;t write your Epithalamium&mdash;and see what a
condition you&rsquo;re like to be brought to.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll speak but three words, and follow
you.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Enough, enough.&nbsp; Careless, bring your
apprehension along with you.</p>
<h3>SCENE III.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mellefont</span>, <span
class="smcap">Careless</span>.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Pert coxcomb.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Faith, &rsquo;tis a good-natured coxcomb, and has
very entertaining follies.&nbsp; You must be more humane to him;
at this juncture it will do me service.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell
you, I would have mirth continued this day at any rate; though
patience purchase folly, and attention be paid with noise, there
are times when sense may be unseasonable as well as truth.&nbsp;
Prithee do thou wear none to-day, but allow Brisk to have wit,
that thou may&rsquo;st seem a fool.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Why, how now, why this extravagant
proposition?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Oh, I would have no room for serious design, for I
am jealous of a plot.&nbsp; I would have noise and impertinence
keep my Lady Touchwood&rsquo;s head from working: for hell is not
more busy than her brain, nor contains more devils than that
imaginations.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; I thought your fear of her had been over.&nbsp; Is
not to-morrow appointed for your marriage with Cynthia, and her
father, Sir Paul Plyant, come to settle the writings this day on
purpose?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; True; but you shall judge whether I have not reason
to be alarmed.&nbsp; None besides you and Maskwell are acquainted
with the secret of my Aunt Touchwood&rsquo;s violent passion for
me.&nbsp; Since my first refusal of her addresses she has
endeavoured to do me all ill offices with my uncle, yet has
managed &rsquo;em with that subtilty, that to him they have borne
the face of kindness; while her malice, like a dark lanthorn,
only shone upon me where it was directed.&nbsp; Still, it gave me
less perplexity to prevent the success of her displeasure than to
avoid the importunities of her love, and of two evils I thought
myself favoured in her aversion.&nbsp; But whether urged by her
despair and the short prospect of time she saw to accomplish her
designs; whether the hopes of revenge, or of her love, terminated
in the view of this my marriage with Cynthia, I know not, but
this morning she surprised me in my bed.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Was there ever such a fury!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis well
nature has not put it into her sex&rsquo;s power to ravish.&nbsp;
Well, bless us, proceed.&nbsp; What followed?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; What at first amazed me&mdash;for I looked to have
seen her in all the transports of a slighted and revengeful
woman&mdash;but when I expected thunder from her voice, and
lightning in her eyes, I saw her melted into tears and hushed
into a sigh.&nbsp; It was long before either of us spoke: passion
had tied her tongue, and amazement mine.&nbsp; In short, the
consequence was thus, she omitted nothing that the most violent
love could urge, or tender words express; which when she saw had
no effect, but still I pleaded honour and nearness of blood to my
uncle, then came the storm I feared at first, for, starting from
my bed-side like a fury, she flew to my sword, and with much ado
I prevented her doing me or herself a mischief.&nbsp; Having
disarmed her, in a gust of passion she left me, and in a
resolution, confirmed by a thousand curses, not to close her eyes
till they had seen my ruin.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Exquisite woman!&nbsp; But what the devil, does
she think thou hast no more sense than to get an heir upon her
body to disinherit thyself? for as I take it this settlement upon
you is, with a proviso, that your uncle have no children.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; It is so.&nbsp; Well, the service you are to do me
will be a pleasure to yourself: I must get you to engage my Lady
Plyant all this evening, that my pious aunt may not work her to
her interest.&nbsp; And if you chance to secure her to yourself,
you may incline her to mine.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s handsome, and
knows it; is very silly, and thinks she has sense, and has an old
fond husband.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; I confess, a very fair foundation for a lover to
build upon.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; For my Lord Froth, he and his wife will be
sufficiently taken up with admiring one another and Brisk&rsquo;s
gallantry, as they call it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll observe my uncle
myself, and Jack Maskwell has promised me to watch my aunt
narrowly, and give me notice upon any suspicion.&nbsp; As for Sir
Paul, my wise father-in-law that is to be, my dear Cynthia has
such a share in his fatherly fondness, he would scarce make her a
moment uneasy to have her happy hereafter.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; So you have manned your works; but I wish you may
not have the weakest guard where the enemy is strongest.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Maskwell, you mean; prithee why should you suspect
him?</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Faith I cannot help it; you know I never liked
him: I am a little superstitious in physiognomy.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; He has obligations of gratitude to bind him to me:
his dependence upon my uncle is through my means.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Upon your aunt, you mean.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; My aunt!</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m mistaken if there be not a familiarity
between them you do not suspect, notwithstanding her passion for
you.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Pooh, pooh! nothing in the world but his design to
do me service; and he endeavours to be well in her esteem, that
he may be able to effect it.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Well, I shall be glad to be mistaken; but your
aunt&rsquo;s aversion in her revenge cannot be any way so
effectually shown as in bringing forth a child to disinherit
you.&nbsp; She is handsome and cunning and naturally
wanton.&nbsp; Maskwell is flesh and blood at best, and
opportunities between them are frequent.&nbsp; His affection to
you, you have confessed, is grounded upon his interest, that you
have transplanted; and should it take root in my lady, I
don&rsquo;t see what you can expect from the fruit.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; I confess the consequence is visible, were your
suspicions just.&nbsp; But see, the company is broke up,
let&rsquo;s meet &rsquo;em.</p>
<h3>SCENE IV.</h3>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Lord Touchwood</span>,
<span class="smcap">Lord Froth</span>, <span class="smcap">Sir
Paul Plyant</span>, <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Brisk</span>.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Out upon&rsquo;t, nephew.&nbsp; Leave your
father-in-law and me to maintain our ground against young
people!</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; I beg your lordship&rsquo;s pardon.&nbsp; We were
just returning.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Were you, son?&nbsp; Gadsbud, much better as
it is.&nbsp; Good, strange!&nbsp; I swear I&rsquo;m almost tipsy;
t&rsquo;other bottle would have been too powerful for
me,&mdash;as sure as can be it would.&nbsp; We wanted your
company, but Mr. Brisk&mdash;where is he?&nbsp; I swear and vow
he&rsquo;s a most facetious person, and the best company.&nbsp;
And, my Lord Froth, your lordship is so merry a man, he, he,
he.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, foy, Sir Paul, what do you mean?&nbsp;
Merry!&nbsp; Oh, barbarous!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d as lieve you called
me fool.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Nay, I protest and vow now, &rsquo;tis true;
when Mr. Brisk jokes, your lordship&rsquo;s laugh does so become
you, he, he, he.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Ridiculous!&nbsp; Sir Paul, you&rsquo;re
strangely mistaken, I find champagne is powerful.&nbsp; I assure
you, Sir Paul, I laugh at nobody&rsquo;s jest but my own, or a
lady&rsquo;s, I assure you, Sir Paul.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; How? how, my lord? what, affront my wit!&nbsp;
Let me perish, do I never say anything worthy to be laughed
at?</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, foy, don&rsquo;t misapprehend me; I
don&rsquo;t say so, for I often smile at your conceptions.&nbsp;
But there is nothing more unbecoming a man of quality than to
laugh; &rsquo;tis such a vulgar expression of the passion;
everybody can laugh.&nbsp; Then especially to laugh at the jest
of an inferior person, or when anybody else of the same quality
does not laugh with one&mdash;ridiculous!&nbsp; To be pleased
with what pleases the crowd!&nbsp; Now when I laugh, I always
laugh alone.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; I suppose that&rsquo;s because you laugh at your
own jests, i&rsquo;gad, ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; He, he, I swear though, your raillery
provokes me to a smile.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Ay, my lord, it&rsquo;s a sign I hit you in the
teeth, if you show &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; He, he, he, I swear that&rsquo;s so very
pretty, I can&rsquo;t forbear.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; I find a quibble bears more sway in your
lordship&rsquo;s face than a jest.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Sir Paul, if you please we&rsquo;ll retire
to the ladies, and drink a dish of tea to settle our heads.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; With all my heart.&nbsp; Mr. Brisk,
you&rsquo;ll come to us, or call me when you joke; I&rsquo;ll be
ready to laugh incontinently.</p>
<h3>SCENE V.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mellefont</span>, <span
class="smcap">Careless</span>, <span class="smcap">Lord
Froth</span>, <span class="smcap">Brisk</span>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; But does your lordship never see comedies?</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Oh yes, sometimes; but I never laugh.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; No?</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Oh no; never laugh indeed, sir.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; No! why, what d&rsquo;ye go there for?</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; To distinguish myself from the commonalty
and mortify the poets; the fellows grow so conceited, when any of
their foolish wit prevails upon the side-boxes.&nbsp; I
swear,&mdash;he, he, he, I have often constrained my inclinations
to laugh,&mdash;he, he, he, to avoid giving them
encouragement.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; You are cruel to yourself, my lord, as well as
malicious to them.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; I confess I did myself some violence at
first, but now I think I have conquered it.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Let me perish, my lord, but there is something
very particular in the humour; &rsquo;tis true it makes against
wit, and I&rsquo;m sorry for some friends of mine that write;
but, i&rsquo;gad, I love to be malicious.&nbsp; Nay, deuce take
me, there&rsquo;s wit in&rsquo;t, too.&nbsp; And wit must be
foiled by wit; cut a diamond with a diamond, no other way,
i&rsquo;gad.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, I thought you would not be long before
you found out the wit.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Wit!&nbsp; In what?&nbsp; Where the devil&rsquo;s
the wit in not laughing when a man has a mind to&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; O Lord, why can&rsquo;t you find it out?&nbsp;
Why, there &rsquo;tis, in the not laughing.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
apprehend me?&nbsp; My lord, Careless is a very honest fellow,
but harkee, you understand me, somewhat heavy, a little shallow,
or so.&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ll tell you now, suppose now you come
up to me&mdash;nay, prithee, Careless, be instructed.&nbsp;
Suppose, as I was saying, you come up to me holding your sides,
and laughing as if you would&mdash;well&mdash;I look grave, and
ask the cause of this immoderate mirth.&nbsp; You laugh on still,
and are not able to tell me, still I look grave, not so much as
smile.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Smile, no, what the devil should you smile at,
when you suppose I can&rsquo;t tell you!</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Pshaw, pshaw, prithee don&rsquo;t interrupt
me.&nbsp; But I tell you, you shall tell me at last, but it shall
be a great while first.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Well, but prithee don&rsquo;t let it be a great
while, because I long to have it over.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Well then, you tell me some good jest or some
very witty thing, laughing all the while as if you were ready to
die, and I hear it, and look thus.&nbsp; Would not you be
disappointed?</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; No; for if it were a witty thing I should not
expect you to understand it.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, foy, Mr. Careless, all the world allows
Mr. Brisk to have wit; my wife says he has a great deal.&nbsp; I
hope you think her a judge.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Pooh, my lord, his voice goes for nothing; I
can&rsquo;t tell how to make him apprehend.&nbsp; Take it
t&rsquo;other way.&nbsp; Suppose I say a witty thing to you?</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Then I shall be disappointed indeed.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Let him alone, Brisk, he is obstinately bent not to
be instructed.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry for him, the deuce take me.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Shall we go to the ladies, my lord?</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; With all my heart; methinks we are a
solitude without &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Or what say you to another bottle of champagne?</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, for the universe not a drop more, I
beseech you.&nbsp; Oh, intemperate!&nbsp; I have a flushing in my
face already.&nbsp; [<i>Takes out a pocket-glass and looks in
it</i>.]</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Let me see, let me see, my lord, I broke my glass
that was in the lid of my snuff-box.&nbsp; Hum!&nbsp; Deuce take
me, I have encouraged a pimple here too.&nbsp; [<i>Takes the
glass and looks</i>.]</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Then you must mortify him with a patch; my
wife shall supply you.&nbsp; Come, gentlemen, <i>allons</i>, here
is company coming.</p>
<h3>SCENE VI.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Maskwell</span>.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll hear no more.&nbsp; You are false
and ungrateful; come, I know you false.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I have been frail, I confess, madam, for your
ladyship&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; That I should trust a man whom I had known
betray his friend!</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; What friend have I betrayed? or to whom?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Your fond friend Mellefont, and to me; can
you deny it?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I do not.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Have you not wronged my lord, who has been a
father to you in your wants, and given you being?&nbsp; Have you
not wronged him in the highest manner, in his bed?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; With your ladyship&rsquo;s help, and for your
service, as I told you before.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t deny that
neither.&nbsp; Anything more, madam?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; More!&nbsp; Audacious villain!&nbsp; Oh,
what&rsquo;s more, is most my shame.&nbsp; Have you not
dishonoured me?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; No, that I deny; for I never told in all my life:
so that accusation&rsquo;s answered; on to the next.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Death, do you dally with my passion?&nbsp;
Insolent devil!&nbsp; But have a care,&mdash;provoke me not; for,
by the eternal fire, you shall not &rsquo;scape my
vengeance.&nbsp; Calm villain!&nbsp; How unconcerned he stands,
confessing treachery and ingratitude!&nbsp; Is there a vice more
black?&nbsp; Oh, I have excuses thousands for my faults; fire in
my temper, passions in my soul, apt to ev&rsquo;ry provocation,
oppressed at once with love, and with despair.&nbsp; But a
sedate, a thinking villain, whose black blood runs temperately
bad, what excuse can clear?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Will you be in temper, madam?&nbsp; I would not
talk not to be heard.&nbsp; I have been [<i>she walks about
disordered</i>] a very great rogue for your sake, and you
reproach me with it; I am ready to be a rogue still, to do you
service; and you are flinging conscience and honour in my face,
to rebate my inclinations.&nbsp; How am I to behave myself?&nbsp;
You know I am your creature, my life and fortune in your power;
to disoblige you brings me certain ruin.&nbsp; Allow it I would
betray you, I would not be a traitor to myself: I don&rsquo;t
pretend to honesty, because you know I am a rascal; but I would
convince you from the necessity of my being firm to you.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Necessity, impudence!&nbsp; Can no gratitude
incline you, no obligations touch you?&nbsp; Have not my fortune
and my person been subjected to your pleasure?&nbsp; Were you not
in the nature of a servant, and have not I in effect made you
lord of all, of me, and of my lord?&nbsp; Where is that humble
love, the languishing, that adoration, which once was paid me,
and everlastingly engaged?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Fixt, rooted in my heart, whence nothing can
remove &rsquo;em, yet you&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Yet, what yet?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Nay, misconceive me not, madam, when I say I have
had a gen&rsquo;rous and a faithful passion, which you had never
favoured, but through revenge and policy.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Ha!</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Look you, madam, we are alone,&mdash;pray contain
yourself and hear me.&nbsp; You know you loved your nephew when I
first sighed for you; I quickly found it: an argument that I
loved, for with that art you veiled your passion &rsquo;twas
imperceptible to all but jealous eyes.&nbsp; This discovery made
me bold; I confess it; for by it I thought you in my power.&nbsp;
Your nephew&rsquo;s scorn of you added to my hopes; I watched the
occasion, and took you, just repulsed by him, warm at once with
love and indignation; your disposition, my arguments, and happy
opportunity accomplished my design; I pressed the yielding
minute, and was blest.&nbsp; How I have loved you since, words
have not shown, then how should words express?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Well, mollifying devil!&nbsp; And have I not
met your love with forward fire?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Your zeal, I grant, was ardent, but misplaced;
there was revenge in view; that woman&rsquo;s idol had defiled
the temple of the god, and love was made a mock-worship.&nbsp; A
son and heir would have edged young Mellefont upon the brink of
ruin, and left him none but you to catch at for prevention.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Again provoke me!&nbsp; Do you wind me like
a larum, only to rouse my own stilled soul for your
diversion?&nbsp; Confusion!</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Nay, madam, I&rsquo;m gone, if you relapse.&nbsp;
What needs this?&nbsp; I say nothing but what you yourself, in
open hours of love, have told me.&nbsp; Why should you deny
it?&nbsp; Nay, how can you?&nbsp; Is not all this present heat
owing to the same fire?&nbsp; Do you not love him still?&nbsp;
How have I this day offended you, but in not breaking off his
match with Cynthia? which, ere to-morrow, shall be done, had you
but patience.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; How, what said you, Maskwell?&nbsp; Another
caprice to unwind my temper?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; By heav&rsquo;n, no; I am your slave, the slave of
all your pleasures; and will not rest till I have given you
peace, would you suffer me.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; O Maskwell! in vain I do disguise me from
thee, thou know&rsquo;st me, knowest the very inmost windings and
recesses of my soul.&nbsp; O Mellefont!&nbsp; I burn; married to
morrow!&nbsp; Despair strikes me.&nbsp; Yet my soul knows I hate
him too: let him but once be mine, and next immediate ruin seize
him.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Compose yourself, you shall possess and ruin him
too,&mdash;will that please you?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; How, how?&nbsp; Thou dear, thou precious
villain, how?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; You have already been tampering with my Lady
Plyant.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; I have: she is ready for any impression I
think fit.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; She must be throughly persuaded that Mellefont
loves her.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; She is so credulous that way naturally, and
likes him so well, that she will believe it faster than I can
persuade her.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t see what you can propose
from such a trifling design, for her first conversing with
Mellefont will convince her of the contrary.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I know it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t depend upon
it.&nbsp; But it will prepare something else, and gain us leisure
to lay a stronger plot.&nbsp; If I gain a little time, I shall
not want contrivance.</p>
<p>One minute gives invention to destroy,</p>
<p>What to rebuild will a whole age employ.</p>
<h2>ACT II.</h2>
<h3>SCENE I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Froth</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Cynthia</span>.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Indeed, madam!&nbsp; Is it possible your ladyship
could have been so much in love?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; I could not sleep; I did not sleep one wink
for three weeks together.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Prodigious!&nbsp; I wonder want of sleep, and so
much love and so much wit as your ladyship has, did not turn your
brain.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, my dear Cynthia, you must not rally your
friend.&nbsp; But really, as you say, I wonder too.&nbsp; But
then I had a way.&nbsp; For, between you and I, I had whimsies
and vapours, but I gave them vent.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; How, pray, madam?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, I writ, writ abundantly.&nbsp; Do you
never write?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Write what?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Songs, elegies, satires, encomiums,
panegyrics, lampoons, plays, or heroic poems?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; O Lord, not I, madam; I&rsquo;m content to be a
courteous reader.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, inconsistent!&nbsp; In love and not
write!&nbsp; If my lord and I had been both of your temper, we
had never come together.&nbsp; Oh, bless me!&nbsp; What a sad
thing would that have been, if my lord and I should never have
met!</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Then neither my lord nor you would ever have met
with your match, on my conscience.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; O&rsquo; my conscience, no more we should;
thou say&rsquo;st right.&nbsp; For sure my Lord Froth is as fine
a gentleman and as much a man of quality!&nbsp; Ah! nothing at
all of the common air.&nbsp; I think I may say he wants nothing
but a blue ribbon and a star to make him shine, the very
phosphorus of our hemisphere.&nbsp; Do you understand those two
hard words?&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll explain
&rsquo;em to you.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Yes, yes, madam, I&rsquo;m not so
ignorant.&mdash;At least I won&rsquo;t own it, to be troubled
with your instructions.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Nay, I beg your pardon; but being derived
from the Greek, I thought you might have escaped the
etymology.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m the more amazed to find you a
woman of letters and not write!&nbsp; Bless me! how can Mellefont
believe you love him?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Why, faith, madam, he that won&rsquo;t take my
word shall never have it under my hand.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; I vow Mellefont&rsquo;s a pretty gentleman,
but methinks he wants a manner.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; A manner!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that, madam?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Some distinguishing quality, as, for
example, the <i>bel air</i> or <i>brillant</i> of Mr. Brisk; the
solemnity, yet complaisance of my lord, or something of his own
that should look a little <i>Je-ne-sais-quoish</i>; he is too
much a mediocrity, in my mind.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; He does not indeed affect either pertness or
formality; for which I like him.&nbsp; Here he comes.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; And my lord with him.&nbsp; Pray observe the
difference.</p>
<h3>SCENE II.</h3>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Lord Froth</span>, <span
class="smcap">Mellefont</span>, <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Brisk</span>.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Impertinent creature!&nbsp; I could almost be
angry with her now.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; My lord, I have been telling Cynthia how
much I have been in love with you; I swear I have; I&rsquo;m not
ashamed to own it now.&nbsp; Ah! it makes my heart leap, I vow I
sigh when I think on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; My dear lord!&nbsp; Ha, ha,
ha, do you remember, my lord?&nbsp; [<i>Squeezes him by the
hand</i>, <i>looks kindly on him</i>, <i>sighs</i>, <i>and then
laughs out</i>.]</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Pleasant creature! perfectly well, ah! that
look, ay, there it is; who could resist? &rsquo;twas so my heart
was made a captive first, and ever since t&rsquo;has been in love
with happy slavery.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, that tongue, that dear deceitful tongue!
that charming softness in your mien and your expression, and then
your bow!&nbsp; Good my lord, bow as you did when I gave you my
picture; here, suppose this my picture. [<i>Gives him a
pocket-glass</i>.]&nbsp; Pray mind, my lord; ah! he bows
charmingly; nay, my lord, you shan&rsquo;t kiss it so much; I
shall grow jealous, I vow now.&nbsp; [<i>He bows profoundly
low</i>, <i>then kisses the glass</i>.]</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; I saw myself there, and kissed it for your
sake.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Gallantry to the last
degree.&nbsp; Mr. Brisk, you&rsquo;re a judge; was ever anything
so well bred as my lord?</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Never anything, but your ladyship; let me
perish.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, prettily turned again; let me die, but
you have a great deal of wit.&nbsp; Mr. Mellefont, don&rsquo;t
you think Mr. Brisk has a world of wit?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; O yes, madam.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; O dear, madam&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; An infinite deal!</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; O heav&rsquo;ns, madam&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; More wit than anybody.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m everlastingly your humble servant,
deuce take me, madam.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think us a happy couple?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I vow, my lord, I think you the happiest couple in
the world, for you&rsquo;re not only happy in one another, and
when you are together, but happy in yourselves, and by
yourselves.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; I hope Mellefont will make a good husband
too.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis my interest to believe he will, my
Lord.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye think he&rsquo;ll love you as
well as I do my wife?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid not.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I believe he&rsquo;ll love me better.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Heav&rsquo;ns! that can never be.&nbsp; But
why do you think so?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Because he has not so much reason to be fond of
himself.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, your humble servant for that, dear
madam.&nbsp; Well, Mellefont, you&rsquo;ll be a happy
creature.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Ay, my lord, I shall have the same reason for my
happiness that your lordship has, I shall think myself happy.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Ah, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lady
Froth</span>.]&nbsp; Your ladyship is in the right; but,
i&rsquo;gad, I&rsquo;m wholly turned into satire.&nbsp; I confess
I write but seldom, but when I do&mdash;keen iambics,
i&rsquo;gad.&nbsp; But my lord was telling me your ladyship has
made an essay toward an heroic poem.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Did my lord tell you?&nbsp; Yes, I vow, and
the subject is my lord&rsquo;s love to me.&nbsp; And what do you
think I call it?&nbsp; I dare swear you won&rsquo;t
guess&mdash;<i>The Sillabub</i>, ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Because my lord&rsquo;s title&rsquo;s Froth,
i&rsquo;gad, ha, ha, ha, deuce take me, very &agrave; propos and
surprising, ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; He, ay, is not it?&nbsp; And then I call my
lord Spumoso; and myself, what d&rsquo;ye think I call
myself?</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Lactilla, may be,&mdash;i&rsquo;gad, I cannot
tell.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Biddy, that&rsquo;s all; just my own
name.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Biddy!&nbsp; I&rsquo;gad, very pretty.&nbsp;
Deuce take me if your ladyship has not the art of surprising the
most naturally in the world.&nbsp; I hope you&rsquo;ll make me
happy in communicating the poem.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, you must be my confidant, I must ask
your advice.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m your humble servant, let me
perish.&nbsp; I presume your ladyship has read Bossu?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Oh yes, and Racine, and Dacier upon
Aristotle and Horace.&nbsp; My lord, you must not be jealous,
I&rsquo;m communicating all to Mr. Brisk.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; No, no, I&rsquo;ll allow Mr. Brisk; have you
nothing about you to shew him, my dear?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Yes, I believe I have.&nbsp; Mr. Brisk,
come, will you go into the next room? and there I&rsquo;ll shew
you what I have.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll walk a turn in the garden, and
come to you.</p>
<h3>SCENE III.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mellefont</span>, <span
class="smcap">Cynthia</span>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re thoughtful, Cynthia?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m thinking, though marriage makes man and
wife one flesh, it leaves &rsquo;em still two fools; and they
become more conspicuous by setting off one another.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s only when two fools meet, and their
follies are opposed.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Nay, I have known two wits meet, and by the
opposition of their wit render themselves as ridiculous as
fools.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an odd game we&rsquo;re going to play
at.&nbsp; What think you of drawing stakes, and giving over in
time?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; No, hang&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s not endeavouring to
win, because it&rsquo;s possible we may lose; since we have
shuffled and cut, let&rsquo;s even turn up trump now.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Then I find it&rsquo;s like cards, if either of us
have a good hand it is an accident of fortune.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; No, marriage is rather like a game at bowls:
fortune indeed makes the match, and the two nearest, and
sometimes the two farthest, are together, but the game depends
entirely upon judgment.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Still it is a game, and consequently one of us
must be a loser.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Not at all; only a friendly trial of skill, and the
winnings to be laid out in an entertainment.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
here, the music?&nbsp; Oh, my lord has promised the company a new
song; we&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em to give it us by the way.&nbsp;
[<i>Musicians crossing the stage</i>.]&nbsp; Pray let us have the
favour of you, to practise the song before the company hear
it.</p>
<p>SONG.</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Cynthia frowns whene&rsquo;er I woo her,<br />
Yet she&rsquo;s vext if I give over;<br />
Much she fears I should undo her,<br />
But much more to lose her lover:<br />
Thus, in doubting, she refuses;<br />
And not winning, thus she loses.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Prithee, Cynthia, look behind you,<br />
Age and wrinkles will o&rsquo;ertake you;<br />
Then too late desire will find you,<br />
When the power must forsake you:<br />
Think, O think o&rsquo; th&rsquo; sad condition,<br />
To be past, yet wish fruition.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; You shall have my thanks below.&nbsp; [<i>To the
musicians</i>, <i>they go out</i>.]</p>
<h3>SCENE IV.</h3>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Sir Paul Plyant</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Plyant</span>.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Gadsbud!&nbsp; I am provoked into a
fermentation, as my Lady Froth says; was ever the like read of in
story?</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Sir Paul, have patience, let me alone to
rattle him up.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Pray, your ladyship, give me leave to be
angry.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll rattle him up, I warrant you, I&rsquo;ll
firk him with a <i>certiorari</i>.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; You firk him, I&rsquo;ll firk him myself;
pray, Sir Paul, hold you contented.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Bless me, what makes my father in such a
passion?&nbsp; I never saw him thus before.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Hold yourself contented, my Lady Plyant.&nbsp;
I find passion coming upon me by inflation, and I cannot submit
as formerly, therefore give way.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; How now! will you be pleased to retire
and&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; No, marry will I not be pleased: I am pleased
to be angry, that&rsquo;s my pleasure at this time.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; What can this mean?</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Gads my life, the man&rsquo;s distracted;
why, how now, who are you?&nbsp; What am I?&nbsp; Slidikins,
can&rsquo;t I govern you?&nbsp; What did I marry you for?&nbsp;
Am I not to be absolute and uncontrollable?&nbsp; Is it fit a
woman of my spirit and conduct should be contradicted in a matter
of this concern?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; It concerns me and only me.&nbsp; Besides,
I&rsquo;m not to be governed at all times.&nbsp; When I am in
tranquillity, my Lady Plyant shall command Sir Paul; but when I
am provoked to fury, I cannot incorporate with patience and
reason: as soon may tigers match with tigers, lambs with lambs,
and every creature couple with its foe, as the poet says.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s hot-headed still!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis in vain to talk to you; but remember I have a
curtain-lecture for you, you disobedient, headstrong brute.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; No, &rsquo;tis because I won&rsquo;t be
headstrong, because I won&rsquo;t be a brute, and have my head
fortified, that I am thus exasperated.&nbsp; But I will protect
my honour, and yonder is the violator of my fame.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis my honour that is concerned, and
the violation was intended to me.&nbsp; Your honour!&nbsp; You
have none but what is in my keeping, and I can dispose of it when
I please: therefore don&rsquo;t provoke me.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Hum, gadsbud, she says true.&nbsp; Well, my
lady, march on; I will fight under you, then: I am convinced, as
far as passion will permit.&nbsp; [<span class="smcap">Lady
Plyant</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Paul</span>
<i>come up to</i> <span class="smcap">Mellefont</span>.]</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Inhuman and treacherous&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Thou serpent and first tempter of
womankind.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Bless me!&nbsp; Sir, madam, what mean you?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Thy, Thy, come away, Thy; touch him not.&nbsp;
Come hither, girl; go not near him, there&rsquo;s nothing but
deceit about him.&nbsp; Snakes are in his peruke, and the
crocodile of Nilus is in his belly; he will eat thee up
alive.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Dishonourable, impudent creature!</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; For heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s sake, madam, to whom do
you direct this language?</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Have I behaved myself with all the decorum
and nicety befitting the person of Sir Paul&rsquo;s wife?&nbsp;
Have I preserved my honour as it were in a snow-house for these
three years past?&nbsp; Have I been white and unsullied even by
Sir Paul himself?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Nay, she has been an invincible wife, even to
me; that&rsquo;s the truth on&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Have I, I say, preserved myself like a fair
sheet of paper for you to make a blot upon?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; And she shall make a simile with any woman in
England.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; I am so amazed, I know not what to say.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Do you think my daughter, this pretty
creature&mdash;gadsbud, she&rsquo;s a wife for a
cherubim!&mdash;do you think her fit for nothing but to be a
stalking horse, to stand before you, while you take aim at my
wife?&nbsp; Gadsbud, I was never angry before in my life, and
I&rsquo;ll never be appeased again.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Hell and damnation!&nbsp; This is my aunt; such
malice can be engendered nowhere else.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Sir Paul, take Cynthia from his sight;
leave me to strike him with the remorse of his intended
crime.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Pray, sir, stay, hear him; I dare affirm
he&rsquo;s innocent.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Innocent!&nbsp; Why, hark&rsquo;ee&mdash;come
hither, Thy&mdash;hark&rsquo;ee, I had it from his aunt, my
sister Touchwood.&nbsp; Gadsbud, he does not care a farthing for
anything of thee but thy portion.&nbsp; Why, he&rsquo;s in love
with my wife.&nbsp; He would have tantalised thee, and made a
cuckold of thy poor father, and that would certainly have broke
my heart.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure, if ever I should have horns, they
would kill me; they would never come kindly&mdash;I should die of
&rsquo;em like a child that was cutting his teeth&mdash;I should
indeed, Thy&mdash;therefore come away; but providence has
prevented all, therefore come away when I bid you.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I must obey.</p>
<h3>SCENE V.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Plyant</span>, <span
class="smcap">Mellefont</span>.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Oh, such a thing! the impiety of it
startles me&mdash;to wrong so good, so fair a creature, and one
that loves you tenderly&mdash;&rsquo;tis a barbarity of
barbarities, and nothing could be guilty of it&mdash;</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; But the greatest villain imagination can form, I
grant it; and next to the villainy of such a fact is the villainy
of aspersing me with the guilt.&nbsp; How? which way was I to
wrong her?&nbsp; For yet I understand you not.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Why, gads my life, cousin Mellefont, you
cannot be so peremptory as to deny it, when I tax you with it to
your face? for now Sir Paul&rsquo;s gone, you are <i>corum
nobus</i>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; By heav&rsquo;n, I love her more than life
or&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Fiddle faddle, don&rsquo;t tell me of this
and that, and everything in the world, but give me mathemacular
demonstration; answer me directly.&nbsp; But I have not
patience.&nbsp; Oh, the impiety of it, as I was saying, and the
unparalleled wickedness!&nbsp; O merciful Father!&nbsp; How could
you think to reverse nature so, to make the daughter the means of
procuring the mother?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; The daughter to procure the mother!</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Ay, for though I am not Cynthia&rsquo;s own
mother, I am her father&rsquo;s wife, and that&rsquo;s near
enough to make it incest.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Incest!&nbsp; O my precious aunt, and the devil in
conjunction.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Oh, reflect upon the horror of that, and
then the guilt of deceiving everybody; marrying the daughter,
only to make a cuckold of the father; and then seducing me,
debauching my purity, and perverting me from the road of virtue
in which I have trod thus long, and never made one trip, not one
<i>faux pas</i>.&nbsp; Oh, consider it!&nbsp; What would you have
to answer for if you should provoke me to frailty?&nbsp; Alas!
humanity is feeble, heav&rsquo;n knows! very feeble, and unable
to support itself.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Where am I? is it day? and am I awake?&nbsp;
Madam&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; And nobody knows how circumstances may
happen together.&nbsp; To my thinking, now I could resist the
strongest temptation.&nbsp; But yet I know, &rsquo;tis impossible
for me to know whether I could or not; there&rsquo;s no certainty
in the things of this life.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Madam, pray give me leave to ask you one
question.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; O Lord, ask me the question; I&rsquo;ll
swear I&rsquo;ll refuse it, I swear I&rsquo;ll deny
it&mdash;therefore don&rsquo;t ask me; nay, you shan&rsquo;t ask
me, I swear I&rsquo;ll deny it.&nbsp; O Gemini, you have brought
all the blood into my face; I warrant I am as red as a
turkey-cock.&nbsp; O fie, cousin Mellefont!</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Nay, madam, hear me; I mean&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Hear you?&nbsp; No, no; I&rsquo;ll deny you
first and hear you afterwards.&nbsp; For one does not know how
one&rsquo;s mind may change upon hearing.&nbsp; Hearing is one of
the senses, and all the senses are fallible.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t
trust my honour, I assure you; my honour is infallible and
uncomeatable.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; For heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s sake, madam&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Oh, name it no more.&nbsp; Bless me, how
can you talk of heav&rsquo;n, and have so much wickedness in your
heart?&nbsp; May be you don&rsquo;t think it a sin&mdash;they say
some of you gentlemen don&rsquo;t think it a sin.&nbsp; May be it
is no sin to them that don&rsquo;t think it so; indeed, if I did
not think it a sin&mdash;But still my honour, if it were no
sin.&nbsp; But then, to marry my daughter for the conveniency of
frequent opportunities, I&rsquo;ll never consent to that; as sure
as can be, I&rsquo;ll break the match.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Death and amazement!&nbsp; Madam, upon my
knees&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Nay, nay, rise up; come, you shall see my
good-nature.&nbsp; I know love is powerful, and nobody can help
his passion.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not your fault; nor, I swear, it is
not mine.&nbsp; How can I help it, if I have charms?&nbsp; And
how can you help it, if you are made a captive?&nbsp; I swear it
is pity it should be a fault.&nbsp; But my honour,&mdash;well,
but your honour, too&mdash;but the sin!&mdash;well, but the
necessity&mdash;O Lord, here&rsquo;s somebody coming, I dare not
stay.&nbsp; Well, you must consider of your crime; and strive as
much as can be against it,&mdash;strive, be sure.&nbsp; But
don&rsquo;t be melancholic; don&rsquo;t despair.&nbsp; But never
think that I&rsquo;ll grant you anything.&nbsp; O Lord, no.&nbsp;
But be sure you lay aside all thoughts of the marriage, for
though I know you don&rsquo;t love Cynthia, only as a blind for
your passion to me, yet it will make me jealous.&nbsp; O Lord,
what did I say?&nbsp; Jealous! no, no, I can&rsquo;t be jealous,
for I must not love you; therefore don&rsquo;t hope,&mdash;but
don&rsquo;t despair neither.&nbsp; Oh, they&rsquo;re coming, I
must fly.</p>
<h3>SCENE VI.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mellefont</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; [<i>After a pause</i>.]&nbsp; So then, spite of my
care and foresight, I am caught, caught in my security.&nbsp; Yet
this was but a shallow artifice, unworthy of my Machiavellian
aunt.&nbsp; There must be more behind: this is but the first
flash, the priming of her engine.&nbsp; Destruction follows hard,
if not most presently prevented.</p>
<h3>SCENE VII.</h3>
<p>[<i>To him</i>] <span class="smcap">Maskwell</span>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Maskwell, welcome, thy presence is a view of land,
appearing to my shipwrecked hopes.&nbsp; The witch has raised the
storm, and her ministers have done their work: you see the
vessels are parted.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I know it.&nbsp; I met Sir Paul towing away
Cynthia.&nbsp; Come, trouble not your head; I&rsquo;ll join you
together ere to-morrow morning, or drown between you in the
attempt.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s comfort in a hand stretched out to
one that&rsquo;s sinking; though ne&rsquo;er so far off.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; No sinking, nor no danger.&nbsp; Come, cheer up;
why, you don&rsquo;t know that while I plead for you, your aunt
has given me a retaining fee.&nbsp; Nay, I am your greatest
enemy, and she does but journey-work under me.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Ha! how&rsquo;s this?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; What d&rsquo;ye think of my being employed in the
execution of all her plots?&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha, by heav&rsquo;n,
it&rsquo;s true: I have undertaken to break the match; I have
undertaken to make your uncle disinherit you; to get you turned
out of doors; and to&mdash;ha, ha, ha, I can&rsquo;t tell you for
laughing.&nbsp; Oh, she has opened her heart to me!&nbsp; I am to
turn you a-grazing, and to&mdash;ha, ha, ha, marry Cynthia
myself.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a plot for you.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Oh, see, I see my rising sun!&nbsp; Light
breaks through clouds upon me, and I shall live in day&mdash;Oh,
my Maskwell! how shall I thank or praise thee?&nbsp; Thou hast
outwitted woman.&nbsp; But, tell me, how couldst thou thus get
into her confidence?&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; How?&nbsp; But was it her
contrivance to persuade my Lady Plyant to this extravagant
belief?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; It was; and to tell you the truth, I encouraged it
for your diversion.&nbsp; Though it made you a little uneasy for
the present, yet the reflection of it must needs be
entertaining.&nbsp; I warrant she was very violent at first.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha, ay, a very fury; but I was most afraid
of her violence at last.&nbsp; If you had not come as you did, I
don&rsquo;t know what she might have attempted.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha, I know her temper.&nbsp; Well, you
must know, then, that all my contrivances were but bubbles, till
at last I pretended to have been long secretly in love with
Cynthia; that did my business, that convinced your aunt I might
be trusted; since it was as much my interest as hers to break the
match.&nbsp; Then, she thought my jealousy might qualify me to
assist her in her revenge.&nbsp; And, in short, in that belief,
told me the secrets of her heart.&nbsp; At length we made this
agreement, if I accomplish her designs (as I told you before) she
has engaged to put Cynthia with all her fortune into my
power.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; She is most gracious in her favour.&nbsp; Well,
and, dear Jack, how hast thou contrived?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I would not have you stay to hear it now; for I
don&rsquo;t know but she may come this way.&nbsp; I am to meet
her anon; after that, I&rsquo;ll tell you the whole matter.&nbsp;
Be here in this gallery an hour hence; by that time I imagine our
consultation may be over.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; I will; till then success attend thee.</p>
<h3>SCENE VIII.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Maskwell</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>Till then, success will attend me; for when I meet you, I meet
the only obstacle to my fortune.&nbsp; Cynthia, let thy beauty
gild my crimes; and whatsoever I commit of treachery or deceit,
shall be imputed to me as a merit.&nbsp; Treachery?&nbsp; What
treachery?&nbsp; Love cancels all the bonds of friendship, and
sets men right upon their first foundations.</p>
<p>Duty to kings, piety to parents, gratitude to benefactors, and
fidelity to friends, are different and particular ties.&nbsp; But
the name of rival cuts &rsquo;em all asunder, and is a general
acquittance.&nbsp; Rival is equal, and love like death an
universal leveller of mankind.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; But is there not
such a thing as honesty?&nbsp; Yes, and whosoever has it about
him, bears an enemy in his breast.&nbsp; For your honest man, as
I take it, is that nice, scrupulous, conscientious person, who
will cheat nobody but himself; such another coxcomb as your wise
man, who is too hard for all the world, and will be made a fool
of by nobody but himself; ha, ha, ha.&nbsp; Well, for wisdom and
honesty give me cunning and hypocrisy; oh, &rsquo;tis such a
pleasure to angle for fair-faced fools!&nbsp; Then that hungry
gudgeon credulity will bite at anything.&nbsp; Why, let me see, I
have the same face, the same words and accents when I speak what
I do think, and when I speak what I do not think, the very same;
and dear dissimulation is the only art not to be known from
nature.</p>
<blockquote><p>Why will mankind be fools, and be deceived,<br />
And why are friends&rsquo; and lovers&rsquo; oaths believed,<br
/>
When each, who searches strictly his own mind,<br />
May so much fraud and power of baseness find?</p>

<h2>ACT III.</h2>
<h3>SCENE I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Touchwood</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span>.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; My lord, can you blame my brother Plyant if
he refuse his daughter upon this provocation?&nbsp; The
contract&rsquo;s void by this unheard-of impiety.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe it true; he has better
principles.&nbsp; Pho, &rsquo;tis nonsense.&nbsp; Come, come, I
know my Lady Plyant has a large eye, and would centre everything
in her own circle; &rsquo;tis not the first time she has mistaken
respect for love, and made Sir Paul jealous of the civility of an
undesigning person, the better to bespeak his security in her
unfeigned pleasures.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; You censure hardly, my lord; my
sister&rsquo;s honour is very well known.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Yes, I believe I know some that have been
familiarly acquainted with it.&nbsp; This is a little trick
wrought by some pitiful contriver, envious of my nephew&rsquo;s
merit.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Nay, my lord, it may be so, and I hope it
will be found so.&nbsp; But that will require some time; for in
such a case as this, demonstration is necessary.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; There should have been demonstration of the
contrary too, before it had been believed.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; So I suppose there was.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Where?&nbsp; When?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; That I can&rsquo;t tell; nay, I don&rsquo;t
say there was.&nbsp; I am willing to believe as favourably of my
nephew as I can.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know that.&nbsp; [<i>Half
aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you believe that, say
you, my lord?</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; No, I don&rsquo;t say so.&nbsp; I confess I
am troubled to find you so cold in his defence.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; His defence!&nbsp; Bless me, would you have
me defend an ill thing?</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; You believe it, then?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know; I am very unwilling to
speak my thoughts in anything that may be to my cousin&rsquo;s
disadvantage: besides, I find, my lord, you are prepared to
receive an ill impression from any opinion of mine which is not
consenting with your own.&nbsp; But, since I am like to be
suspected in the end, and &rsquo;tis a pain any longer to
dissemble, I own it to you; in short I do believe it, nay, and
can believe anything worse, if it were laid to his charge.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t ask me my reasons, my lord, for they are not fit to
be told you.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m amazed: there must be something
more than ordinary in this.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Not fit
to be told me, madam?&nbsp; You can have no interests wherein I
am not concerned, and consequently the same reasons ought to be
convincing to me, which create your satisfaction or disquiet.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; But those which cause my disquiet I am
willing to have remote from your hearing.&nbsp; Good my lord,
don&rsquo;t press me.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t oblige me to press you.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Whatever it was, &rsquo;tis past.&nbsp; And
that is better to be unknown which cannot be prevented; therefore
let me beg you to rest satisfied.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; When you have told me, I will.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; By my life, my dear, I will.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; What if you can&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Then I must know, nay, I
will.&nbsp; No more trifling.&nbsp; I charge you tell me.&nbsp;
By all our mutual peace to come; upon your duty&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Nay, my lord, you need say no more, to make
me lay my heart before you, but don&rsquo;t be thus transported;
compose yourself.&nbsp; It is not of concern to make you lose one
minute&rsquo;s temper.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not, indeed, my
dear.&nbsp; Nay, by this kiss you shan&rsquo;t be angry.&nbsp; O
Lord, I wish I had not told you anything.&nbsp; Indeed, my lord,
you have frighted me.&nbsp; Nay, look pleased, I&rsquo;ll tell
you.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Well, well.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Nay, but will you be calm?&nbsp; Indeed
it&rsquo;s nothing but&mdash;</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; But what?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; But will you promise me not to be
angry?&nbsp; Nay, you must&mdash;not to be angry with
Mellefont?&nbsp; I dare swear he&rsquo;s sorry, and were it to do
again, would not&mdash;</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Sorry for what?&nbsp; &rsquo;Death, you rack
me with delay.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Nay, no great matter, only&mdash;well, I
have your promise.&nbsp; Pho, why nothing, only your nephew had a
mind to amuse himself sometimes with a little gallantry towards
me.&nbsp; Nay, I can&rsquo;t think he meant anything seriously,
but methought it looked oddly.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Confusion and hell, what do I hear?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Or, may be, he thought he was not enough
akin to me, upon your account, and had a mind to create a nearer
relation on his own; a lover you know, my lord.&nbsp; Ha, ha,
ha.&nbsp; Well, but that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; Now you have it; well
remember your promise, my lord, and don&rsquo;t take any notice
of it to him.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; No, no, no.&nbsp; Damnation!</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Nay, I swear you must not.&nbsp; A little
harmless mirth; only misplaced, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; But if it
were more, &rsquo;tis over now, and all&rsquo;s well.&nbsp; For
my part I have forgot it, and so has he, I hope,&mdash;for I have
not heard anything from him these two days.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; These two days!&nbsp; Is it so fresh?&nbsp;
Unnatural villain!&nbsp; Death, I&rsquo;ll have him stripped and
turned naked out of my doors this moment, and let him rot and
perish, incestuous brute!</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Oh, for heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s sake, my lord,
you&rsquo;ll ruin me if you take such public notice of it; it
will be a town talk.&nbsp; Consider your own and my honour; nay,
I told you you would not be satisfied when you knew it.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Before I&rsquo;ve done I will be
satisfied.&nbsp; Ungrateful monster! how long?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Lord, I don&rsquo;t know; I wish my lips had
grown together when I told you.&nbsp; Almost a twelvemonth.&nbsp;
Nay, I won&rsquo;t tell you any more till you are yourself.&nbsp;
Pray, my lord, don&rsquo;t let the company see you in this
disorder.&nbsp; Yet, I confess, I can&rsquo;t blame you; for I
think I was never so surprised in my life.&nbsp; Who would have
thought my nephew could have so misconstrued my kindness?&nbsp;
But will you go into your closet, and recover your temper.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll make an excuse of sudden business to the company, and
come to you.&nbsp; Pray, good, dear my lord, let me beg you do
now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come immediately and tell you all; will
you, my lord?</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I will&mdash;I am mute with wonder.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Well, but go now, here&rsquo;s somebody
coming.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Well, I go.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t stay? for
I would hear more of this.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; I follow instantly.&nbsp; So.</p>
<h3>SCENE II.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span>, <span

<p>MASK.&nbsp; This was a masterpiece, and did not need my help,
though I stood ready for a cue to come in and confirm all, had
there been occasion.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Have you seen Mellefont?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I have; and am to meet him here about this
time.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; How does he bear his disappointment?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Secure in my assistance, he seemed not much
afflicted, but rather laughed at the shallow artifice, which so
little time must of necessity discover.&nbsp; Yet he is
apprehensive of some farther design of yours, and has engaged me
to watch you.&nbsp; I believe he will hardly be able to prevent
your plot, yet I would have you use caution and expedition.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Expedition indeed, for all we do must be
performed in the remaining part of this evening, and before the
company break up, lest my lord should cool and have an
opportunity to talk with him privately.&nbsp; My lord must not
see him again.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; By no means; therefore you must aggravate my
lord&rsquo;s displeasure to a degree that will admit of no
conference with him.&nbsp; What think you of mentioning me?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; How?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; To my lord, as having been privy to
Mellefont&rsquo;s design upon you, but still using my utmost
endeavours to dissuade him, though my friendship and love to him
has made me conceal it; yet you may say, I threatened the next
time he attempted anything of that kind to discover it to my
lord.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; To what end is this?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; It will confirm my lord&rsquo;s opinion of my
honour and honesty, and create in him a new confidence in me,
which (should this design miscarry) will be necessary to the
forming another plot that I have in my head.&mdash;To cheat you
as well as the rest.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll do it&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell him
you hindered him once from forcing me.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Excellent!&nbsp; Your ladyship has a most
improving fancy.&nbsp; You had best go to my lord, keep him as
long as you can in his closet, and I doubt not but you will mould
him to what you please; your guests are so engaged in their own
follies and intrigues, they&rsquo;ll miss neither of you.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; When shall we meet?&mdash;at eight this
evening in my chamber?&nbsp; There rejoice at our success, and
toy away an hour in mirth.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I will not fail.</p>
<h3>SCENE III.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Maskwell</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>I know what she means by toying away an hour well
enough.&nbsp; Pox, I have lost all appetite to her; yet
she&rsquo;s a fine woman, and I loved her once.&nbsp; But I
don&rsquo;t know: since I have been in a great measure kept by
her, the case is altered; what was my pleasure is become my duty,
and I have as little stomach to her now as if I were her
husband.&nbsp; Should she smoke my design upon Cynthia, I were in
a fine pickle.&nbsp; She has a damned penetrating head, and knows
how to interpret a coldness the right way; therefore I must
dissemble ardour and ecstasy; that&rsquo;s resolved.&nbsp; How
easily and pleasantly is that dissembled before fruition!&nbsp;
Pox on&rsquo;t that a man can&rsquo;t drink without quenching his
thirst.&nbsp; Ha! yonder comes Mellefont, thoughtful.&nbsp; Let
me think.&nbsp; Meet her at eight&mdash;hum&mdash;ha!&nbsp; By
heav&rsquo;n I have it.&mdash;If I can speak to my lord
before.&nbsp; Was it my brain or providence?&nbsp; No matter
which&mdash;I will deceive &rsquo;em all, and yet secure
myself.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a lucky thought!&nbsp; Well, this
double-dealing is a jewel.&nbsp; Here he comes, now for me.&nbsp;
[<span class="smcap">Maskwell</span>, <i>pretending not to see
him</i>, <i>walks by him</i>, <i>and speaks as it were to
himself</i>.]</p>
<h3>SCENE IV.</h3>
<p>[<i>To him</i>] <span class="smcap">Mellefont</span>,
<i>musing</i>.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Mercy on us, what will the wickedness of this
world come to?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; How now, Jack?&nbsp; What, so full of contemplation
that you run over?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re come, for I could not
contain myself any longer, and was just going to give vent to a
secret, which nobody but you ought to drink down.&nbsp; Your
aunt&rsquo;s just gone from hence.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; And having trusted thee with the secrets of her
soul, thou art villainously bent to discover &rsquo;em all to me,
ha?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid my frailty leans that way.&nbsp;
But I don&rsquo;t know whether I can in honour discover &rsquo;em
all.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; All, all, man!&nbsp; What, you may in honour betray
her as far as she betrays herself.&nbsp; No tragical design upon
my person, I hope.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; No, but it&rsquo;s a comical design upon mine.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; What dost thou mean?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Listen and be dumb; we have been bargaining about
the rate of your ruin&mdash;</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Like any two guardians to an orphan heiress.&nbsp;
Well?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; And whereas pleasure is generally paid with
mischief, what mischief I do is to be paid with pleasure.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; So when you&rsquo;ve swallowed the potion you
sweeten your mouth with a plum.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; You are merry, sir, but I shall probe your
constitution.&nbsp; In short, the price of your banishment is to
be paid with the person of&mdash;</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Of Cynthia and her fortune.&nbsp; Why, you forget
you told me this before.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; So far you are right; and I am, as
an earnest of that bargain, to have full and free possession of
the person of&mdash;your aunt.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Pho, you trifle.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; By this light, I&rsquo;m serious; all raillery
apart.&nbsp; I knew &rsquo;twould stun you.&nbsp; This evening at
eight she will receive me in her bedchamber.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Hell and the devil, is she abandoned of all
grace?&nbsp; Why, the woman is possessed.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Well, will you go in my stead?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; By heav&rsquo;n, into a hot furnace sooner.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; No, you would not; it would not be so convenient,
as I can order matters.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; What d&rsquo;ye mean?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Mean?&nbsp; Not to disappoint the lady, I assure
you.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha, how gravely he looks.&nbsp; Come, come, I
won&rsquo;t perplex you.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the only thing that
providence could have contrived to make me capable of serving
you, either to my inclination or your own necessity.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; How, how, for heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s sake, dear
Maskwell?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Why, thus.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go according to
appointment; you shall have notice at the critical minute to come
and surprise your aunt and me together.&nbsp; Counterfeit a rage
against me, and I&rsquo;ll make my escape through the private
passage from her chamber, which I&rsquo;ll take care to leave
open.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be hard if then you can&rsquo;t bring
her to any conditions.&nbsp; For this discovery will disarm her
of all defence, and leave her entirely at your mercy&mdash;nay,
she must ever after be in awe of you.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Let me adore thee, my better genius!&nbsp; By
heav&rsquo;n I think it is not in the power of fate to disappoint
my hopes&mdash;my hopes?&nbsp; My certainty!</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll meet you here, within a quarter
of eight, and give you notice.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Good fortune ever go along with thee.</p>
<h3>SCENE V.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mellefont</span>, <span
class="smcap">Careless</span>.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Mellefont, get out o&rsquo; th&rsquo; way, my Lady
Plyant&rsquo;s coming, and I shall never succeed while thou art
in sight.&nbsp; Though she begins to tack about; but I made love
a great while to no purpose.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
convinced that I don&rsquo;t care for her.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t get an answer from her, that does
not begin with her honour, or her virtue, her religion, or some
such cant.&nbsp; Then she has told me the whole history of Sir
Paul&rsquo;s nine years courtship; how he has lain for whole
nights together upon the stairs before her chamber-door; and that
the first favour he received from her was a piece of an old
scarlet petticoat for a stomacher, which since the day of his
marriage he has out of a piece of gallantry converted into a
night-cap, and wears it still with much solemnity on his
anniversary wedding-night.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; That I have seen, with the ceremony thereunto
belonging.&nbsp; For on that night he creeps in at the
bed&rsquo;s feet like a gulled bassa that has married a relation
of the Grand Signior, and that night he has his arms at
liberty.&nbsp; Did not she tell you at what a distance she keeps
him?&nbsp; He has confessed to me that, but at some certain
times, that is, I suppose, when she apprehends being with child,
he never has the privilege of using the familiarity of a husband
with a wife.&nbsp; He was once given to scrambling with his
hands, and sprawling in his sleep, and ever since she has him
swaddled up in blankets, and his hands and feet swathed down, and
so put to bed; and there he lies with a great beard, like a
Russian bear upon a drift of snow.&nbsp; You are very great with
him, I wonder he never told you his grievances: he will, I
warrant you.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Excessively foolish!&nbsp; But that which gives me
most hopes of her is her telling me of the many temptations she
has resisted.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Nay, then you have her; for a woman&rsquo;s
bragging to a man that she has overcome temptations is an
argument that they were weakly offered, and a challenge to him to
engage her more irresistibly.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis only an enhancing
the price of the commodity, by telling you how many customers
have underbid her.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Nay, I don&rsquo;t despair.&nbsp; But still she
has a grudging to you.&nbsp; I talked to her t&rsquo;other night
at my Lord Froth&rsquo;s masquerade, when I&rsquo;m satisfied she
knew me, and I had no reason to complain of my reception; but I
find women are not the same bare-faced and in masks, and a vizor
disguises their inclinations as much as their faces.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a mistake, for women may most properly
be said to be unmasked when they wear vizors; for that secures
them from blushing and being out of countenance, and next to
being in the dark, or alone, they are most truly themselves in a
vizor mask.&nbsp; Here they come: I&rsquo;ll leave you.&nbsp; Ply
her close, and by and by clap a <i>billet doux</i> into her hand;
for a woman never thinks a man truly in love with her, till he
has been fool enough to think of her out of her sight, and to
lose so much time as to write to her.</p>
<h3>SCENE VI.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Careless</span>, <span class="smcap">Sir
Paul</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lady
Plyant</span>.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Shan&rsquo;t we disturb your meditation, Mr.
Careless?&nbsp; You would be private?</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; You bring that along with you, Sir Paul, that
shall be always welcome to my privacy.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; O sweet sir, you load your humble servants,
both me and my wife, with continual favours.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Sir Paul, what a phrase was there?&nbsp;
You will be making answers, and taking that upon you which ought
to lie upon me.&nbsp; That you should have so little breeding to
think Mr. Careless did not apply himself to me.&nbsp; Pray what
have you to entertain anybody&rsquo;s privacy?&nbsp; I swear and
declare in the face of the world I&rsquo;m ready to blush for
your ignorance.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; I acquiesce, my lady; but don&rsquo;t snub so
loud.&nbsp; [<i>Aside to her</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Mr. Careless, if a person that is wholly
illiterate might be supposed to be capable of being qualified to
make a suitable return to those obligations, which you are
pleased to confer upon one that is wholly incapable of being
qualified in all those circumstances, I&rsquo;m sure I should
rather attempt it than anything in the world, [<i>Courtesies</i>]
for I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s nothing in the world that I
would rather.&nbsp; [<i>Courtesies</i>]&nbsp; But I know Mr.
Careless is so great a critic, and so fine a gentleman, that it
is impossible for me&mdash;</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; O heavens! madam, you confound me.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Gads-bud, she&rsquo;s a fine person.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; O Lord! sir, pardon me, we women have not
those advantages; I know my imperfections.&nbsp; But at the same
time you must give me leave to declare in the face of the world
that nobody is more sensible of favours and things; for with the
reserve of my honour I assure you, Mr. Careless, I don&rsquo;t
know anything in the world I would refuse to a person so
meritorious.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll pardon my want of expression.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; O, your ladyship is abounding in all excellence,
particularly that of phrase.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; You are so obliging, sir.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Your ladyship is so charming.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; So, now, now; now, my lady.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; So well bred.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; So surprising.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; So well dressed, so <i>bonne mine</i>, so
eloquent, so unaffected, so easy, so free, so particular, so
agreeable.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Ay, so, so, there.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; O Lord, I beseech you madam, don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; So gay, so graceful, so good teeth, so fine
shape, so fine limbs, so fine linen, and I don&rsquo;t doubt but
you have a very good skin, sir,</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; For heaven&rsquo;s sake, madam, I&rsquo;m quite
out of countenance.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; And my lady&rsquo;s quite out of breath; or
else you should hear&mdash;Gads-bud, you may talk of my Lady
Froth.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; O fie, fie, not to be named of a day.&nbsp; My
Lady Froth is very well in her accomplishments.&nbsp; But it is
when my Lady Plyant is not thought of.&nbsp; If that can ever
be.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; O, you overcome me.&nbsp; That is so
excessive.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Nay, I swear and vow that was pretty.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; O, Sir Paul, you are the happiest man alive.&nbsp;
Such a lady! that is the envy of her own sex, and the admiration
of ours.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Your humble servant.&nbsp; I am, I thank
heaven, in a fine way of living, as I may say, peacefully and
happily, and I think need not envy any of my neighbours, blessed
be providence.&nbsp; Ay, truly, Mr. Careless, my lady is a great
blessing, a fine, discreet, well-spoken woman as you shall see,
if it becomes me to say so, and we live very comfortably
together; she is a little hasty sometimes, and so am I; but
mine&rsquo;s soon over, and then I&rsquo;m so sorry.&mdash;O Mr.
Careless, if it were not for one thing&mdash;</p>
<h3>SCENE VII.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Careless</span>, <span class="smcap">Sir
Paul</span>, <span class="smcap">Lady Plyant</span>, <span
class="smcap">Boy</span> <i>with a letter</i>.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; How often have you been told of that, you
jackanapes?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Gad so, gad&rsquo;s-bud.&nbsp; Tim, carry it
to my lady, you should have carried it to my lady first.</p>
<p>BOY.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis directed to your worship.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Well, well, my lady reads all letters
first.&nbsp; Child, do so no more; d&rsquo;ye hear, Tim.</p>
<p>BOY.&nbsp; No, and please you.</p>
<h3>SCENE VIII.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Careless</span>, <span class="smcap">Sir
Paul</span>, <span class="smcap">Lady Plyant</span>.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; A humour of my wife&rsquo;s: you know women
have little fancies.&nbsp; But as I was telling you, Mr.
Careless, if it were not for one thing, I should think myself the
happiest man in the world; indeed that touches me near, very
near.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; What can that be, Sir Paul?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Why, I have, I thank heaven, a very plentiful
fortune, a good estate in the country, some houses in town, and
some money, a pretty tolerable personal estate; and it is a great
grief to me, indeed it is, Mr. Careless, that I have not a son to
inherit this.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true I have a daughter, and a fine
dutiful child she is, though I say it, blessed be providence I
may say; for indeed, Mr. Careless, I am mightily beholden to
providence.&nbsp; A poor unworthy sinner.&nbsp; But if I had a
son!&nbsp; Ah, that&rsquo;s my affliction, and my only
affliction; indeed I cannot refrain tears when it comes in my
mind.&nbsp; [<i>Cries</i>.]</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Why, methinks that might be easily
remedied&mdash;my lady&rsquo;s a fine likely woman&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Oh, a fine likely woman as you shall see in a
summer&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; Indeed she is, Mr. Careless, in all
respects.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; And I should not have taken you to have been so
old&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Alas, that&rsquo;s not it, Mr. Careless; ah!
that&rsquo;s not it; no, no, you shoot wide of the mark a mile;
indeed you do, that&rsquo;s not it, Mr. Careless; no, no,
that&rsquo;s not it.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; No?&nbsp; What can be the matter then?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll scarcely believe me when I shall
tell you&mdash;my lady is so nice.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very strange,
but it&rsquo;s true; too true&mdash;she&rsquo;s so very nice,
that I don&rsquo;t believe she would touch a man for the
world.&nbsp; At least not above once a year; I&rsquo;m sure I
have found it so; and, alas, what&rsquo;s once a year to an old
man, who would do good in his generation?&nbsp; Indeed it&rsquo;s
true, Mr. Careless, it breaks my heart.&nbsp; I am her husband,
as I may say; though far unworthy of that honour, yet I am her
husband; but alas-a-day, I have no more familiarity with her
person&mdash;as to that matter&mdash;than with my own
mother&mdash;no indeed.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Alas-a-day, this is a lamentable story.&nbsp; My
lady must be told on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She must i&rsquo;faith, Sir
Paul; &rsquo;tis an injury to the world.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Ah! would to heaven you would, Mr. Careless;
you are mightily in her favour.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; I warrant you, what! we must have a son some way
or other.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Indeed I should be mightily bound to you if
you could bring it about, Mr. Careless.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Here, Sir Paul, it&rsquo;s from your
steward.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a return of 600 pounds; you may take
fifty of it for the next half year.&nbsp; [<i>Gives him the

<h3>SCENE IX.</h3>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Lord Froth</span>, <span
class="smcap">Cynthia</span>.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; How does my girl?&nbsp; Come hither to thy
father, poor lamb: thou&rsquo;rt melancholic.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Heaven, Sir Paul, you amaze me, of all
things in the world.&nbsp; You are never pleased but when we are
all upon the broad grin: all laugh and no company; ah, then
&rsquo;tis such a sight to see some teeth.&nbsp; Sure
you&rsquo;re a great admirer of my Lady Whifler, Mr. Sneer, and
Sir Laurence Loud, and that gang.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; I vow and swear she&rsquo;s a very merry
woman; but I think she laughs a little too much.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Merry!&nbsp; O Lord, what a character that
is of a woman of quality.&nbsp; You have been at my Lady
Whifler&rsquo;s upon her day, madam?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Yes, my lord.&nbsp; I must humour this fool.&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Well, and how? hee!&nbsp; What is your sense
of the conversation?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Oh, most ridiculous, a perpetual comfort of
laughing without any harmony; for sure, my lord, to laugh out of
time, is as disagreeable as to sing out of time or out of
tune.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Hee, hee, hee, right; and then, my Lady
Whifler is so ready&mdash;she always comes in three bars too
soon.&nbsp; And then, what do they laugh at?&nbsp; For you know
laughing without a jest is as impertinent, hee! as, as&mdash;</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; As dancing without a fiddle.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Just i&rsquo;faith, that was at my
tongue&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; But that cannot be properly said of them, for I
think they are all in good nature with the world, and only laugh
at one another; and you must allow they have all jests in their
persons, though they have none in their conversation.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; True, as I&rsquo;m a person of honour.&nbsp;
For heaven&rsquo;s sake let us sacrifice &rsquo;em to mirth a
little.&nbsp; [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Boy</span> <i>and

<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Gads so.&mdash;Wife, wife, my Lady Plyant, I
have a word.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m busy, Sir Paul, I wonder at your
impertinence.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Sir Paul, harkee, I&rsquo;m reasoning the matter
you know.&nbsp; Madam, if your ladyship please, we&rsquo;ll
discourse of this in the next room.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; O ho, I wish you good success, I wish you good
success.&nbsp; Boy, tell my lady, when she has done, I would
speak with her below.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia</span>, <span class="smcap">Lord
Froth</span>, <span class="smcap">Lady Froth</span>, <span
class="smcap">Brisk</span>.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Then you think that episode between Susan,
the dairy-maid, and our coachman is not amiss; you know, I may
suppose the dairy in town, as well as in the country.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Incomparable, let me perish.&nbsp; But then,
being an heroic poem, had you not better call him a
charioteer?&nbsp; Charioteer sounds great; besides, your
ladyship&rsquo;s coachman having a red face, and you comparing
him to the sun&mdash;and you know the sun is called
Heaven&rsquo;s charioteer.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, infinitely better; I&rsquo;m extremely
beholden to you for the hint; stay, we&rsquo;ll read over those
half a score lines again.&nbsp; [<i>Pulls out a paper</i>.]&nbsp;
Let me see here, you know what goes before,&mdash;the comparison,
you know.&nbsp; [<i>Reads</i>.]</p>
<blockquote><p>For as the sun shines ev&rsquo;ry day,<br />
So of our coachman I may say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid that simile won&rsquo;t do in
wet weather; because you say the sun shines every day.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; No; for the sun it won&rsquo;t, but it will
do for the coachman, for you know there&rsquo;s most occasion for
a coach in wet weather.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Right, right, that saves all.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Then I don&rsquo;t say the sun shines all
the day, but that he peeps now and then; yet he does shine all
the day too, you know, though we don&rsquo;t see him.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Right, but the vulgar will never comprehend
that.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Well, you shall hear.&nbsp; Let me
see.&nbsp; [<i>Reads</i>.]</p>
<blockquote><p>For as the sun shines ev&rsquo;ry day,<br />
So of our coachman I may say,<br />
He shows his drunken fiery face,<br />
Just as the sun does, more or less.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right, all&rsquo;s well, all&rsquo;s
well.&nbsp; &lsquo;More or less.&rsquo;</p>
<p>LADY FROTH reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>And when at night his labour&rsquo;s done,<br />
Then too, like Heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s charioteer the sun:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ay, charioteer does better.</p>
<blockquote><p>Into the dairy he descends,<br />
And there his whipping and his driving ends;<br />
There he&rsquo;s secure from danger of a bilk,<br />
His fare is paid him, and he sets in milk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Susan you know, is Thetis, and so&mdash;</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Incomparable well and proper, egad&mdash;but I
have one exception to make&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think
bilk&mdash;(I know it&rsquo;s good rhyme)&mdash;but don&rsquo;t
you think <i>bilk</i> and <i>fare</i> too like a hackney
coachman?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; I swear and vow I&rsquo;m afraid so.&nbsp;
And yet our Jehu was a hackney coachman, when my lord took
him.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Was he?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m answered, if Jehu was a
hackney coachman.&nbsp; You may put that in the marginal notes
though, to prevent criticism&mdash;only mark it with a small
asterism, and say, &lsquo;Jehu was formerly a hackney
coachman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; I will.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d oblige me
extremely to write notes to the whole poem.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; With all my heart and soul, and proud of the vast
honour, let me perish.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Hee, hee, hee, my dear, have you done?
won&rsquo;t you join with us?&nbsp; We were laughing at my Lady
Whifler and Mr. Sneer.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Ay, my dear, were you?&nbsp; Oh, filthy Mr.
Sneer; he&rsquo;s a nauseous figure, a most fulsamic fop,
foh!&nbsp; He spent two days together in going about Covent
Garden to suit the lining of his coach with his complexion.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; O silly! yet his aunt is as fond of him as
if she had brought the ape into the world herself.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Who, my Lady Toothless?&nbsp; Oh, she&rsquo;s a
mortifying spectacle; she&rsquo;s always chewing the cud like an
old ewe.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Fie, Mr. Brisk, eringo&rsquo;s for her cough.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; I have seen her take &rsquo;em half chewed
out of her mouth, to laugh, and then put &rsquo;em in
again.&nbsp; Foh!</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Foh!</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Then she&rsquo;s always ready to laugh when
Sneer offers to speak, and sits in expectation of his no jest,
with her gums bare, and her mouth open&mdash;</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Like an oyster at low ebb, egad.&nbsp; Ha, ha,
ha!</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>]&nbsp; Well, I find there are no
fools so inconsiderable in themselves but they can render other
people contemptible by exposing their infirmities.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Then that t&rsquo;other great strapping
lady&mdash;I can&rsquo;t hit of her name; the old fat fool that
paints so exorbitantly.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; I know whom you mean&mdash;but deuce take me, I
can&rsquo;t hit of her name neither.&nbsp; Paints, d&rsquo;ye
say?&nbsp; Why, she lays it on with a trowel.&nbsp; Then she has
a great beard that bristles through it, and makes her look as if
she were plastered with lime and hair, let me perish.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, you made a song upon her, Mr. Brisk.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; He! egad, so I did.&nbsp; My lord can sing
it.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; O good, my lord, let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not a song neither, it&rsquo;s a sort
of an epigram, or rather an epigrammatic sonnet; I don&rsquo;t
know what to call it, but it&rsquo;s satire.&nbsp; Sing it, my
lord.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH sings.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ancient Phyllis has young graces,<br />
&rsquo;Tis a strange thing, but a true one;<br />
Shall I tell you how?<br />
She herself makes her own faces,<br />
And each morning wears a new one;<br />
Where&rsquo;s the wonder now?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Short, but there&rsquo;s salt in&rsquo;t; my way
of writing, egad.</p>
<h3>SCENE XI.</h3>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Footman</span>.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; How now?</p>
<p>FOOT.&nbsp; Your ladyship&rsquo;s chair is come.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Is nurse and the child in it?</p>
<p>FOOT.&nbsp; Yes, madam.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; O the dear creature!&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s go
see it.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; I swear, my dear, you&rsquo;ll spoil that
child, with sending it to and again so often; this is the seventh
time the chair has gone for her to-day.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; O law!&nbsp; I swear it&rsquo;s but the
sixth&mdash;and I haven&rsquo;t seen her these two hours.&nbsp;
The poor creature&mdash;I swear, my lord, you don&rsquo;t love
poor little Sapho.&nbsp; Come, my dear Cynthia, Mr. Brisk,
we&rsquo;ll go see Sapho, though my lord won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wait upon your ladyship.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Pray, madam, how old is Lady Sapho?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Three-quarters, but I swear she has a world
of wit, and can sing a tune already.&nbsp; My lord, won&rsquo;t
you go?&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; What! not to see Saph?&nbsp;
Pray, my lord, come see little Saph.&nbsp; I knew you could not
stay.</p>
<h3>SCENE XII.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not so hard to counterfeit joy in the
depth of affliction, as to dissemble mirth in company of
fools.&nbsp; Why should I call &rsquo;em fools?&nbsp; The world
thinks better of &rsquo;em; for these have quality and education,
wit and fine conversation, are received and admired by the
world.&nbsp; If not, they like and admire themselves.&nbsp; And
why is not that true wisdom? for &rsquo;tis happiness: and for
ought I know, we have misapplied the name all this while, and
mistaken the thing: since</p>
<blockquote><p>If happiness in self-content is placed,<br />
The wise are wretched, and fools only bless&rsquo;d.</p>

<h2>ACT IV.</h2>
<h3>SCENE I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mellefont</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Cynthia</span>.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I heard him loud as I came by the closet-door, and
my lady with him, but she seemed to moderate his passion.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Ay, hell thank her, as gentle breezes moderate a
fire; but I shall counter-work her spells, and ride the witch in
her own bridle.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s impossible; she&rsquo;ll cast beyond
you still.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll lay my life it will never be a
match.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Between you and me.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Why so?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; My mind gives me it won&rsquo;t, because we are
both willing.&nbsp; We each of us strive to reach the goal, and
hinder one another in the race.&nbsp; I swear it never does well
when the parties are so agreed; for when people walk hand in hand
there&rsquo;s neither overtaking nor meeting.&nbsp; We hunt in
couples, where we both pursue the same game but forget one
another; and &rsquo;tis because we are so near that we
don&rsquo;t think of coming together.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Hum, &rsquo;gad I believe there&rsquo;s something
in it.&nbsp; Marriage is the game that we hunt, and while we
think that we only have it in view, I don&rsquo;t see but we have
it in our power.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Within reach; for example, give me your
hand.&nbsp; You have looked through the wrong end of the
perspective all this while, for nothing has been between us but
our fears.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why we should not steal out of
the house this very moment and marry one another, without
consideration or the fear of repentance.&nbsp; Pox o&rsquo;
fortune, portion, settlements, and jointures.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Ay, ay, what have we to do with &rsquo;em?&nbsp;
You know we marry for love.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Love, love, downright, very villainous love.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; And he that can&rsquo;t live upon love deserves to
die in a ditch.&nbsp; Here then, I give you my promise, in spite
of duty, any temptation of wealth, your inconstancy, or my own
inclination to change&mdash;</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; To run most wilfully and unreasonably away with me
this moment and be married.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Hold.&nbsp; Never to marry anybody else.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s but a kind of negative consent.&nbsp;
Why, you won&rsquo;t baulk the frolic?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; If you had not been so assured of your own conduct
I would not.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis but reasonable that since I
consent to like a man without the vile consideration of money, he
should give me a very evident demonstration of his wit: therefore
let me see you undermine my Lady Touchwood, as you boasted, and
force her to give her consent, and then&mdash;</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll do&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll do&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; This very next ensuing hour of eight o&rsquo;clock
is the last minute of her reign, unless the devil assist her
<i>in propri&acirc; person&acirc;</i>.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Well, if the devil should assist her, and your
plot miscarry&mdash;</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Ay, what am I to trust to then?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Why, if you give me very clear demonstration that
it was the devil, I&rsquo;ll allow for irresistible odds.&nbsp;
But if I find it to be only chance, or destiny, or unlucky stars,
or anything but the very devil, I&rsquo;m inexorable: only still
I&rsquo;ll keep my word, and live a maid for your sake.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; And you won&rsquo;t die one, for your own, so still
there&rsquo;s hope.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s my mother-in-law, and your friend
Careless; I would not have &rsquo;em see us together yet.</p>
<h3>SCENE II.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Careless</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Lady Plyant</span>.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; I swear, Mr. Careless, you are very
alluring, and say so many fine things, and nothing is so moving
to me as a fine thing.&nbsp; Well, I must do you this justice,
and declare in the face of the world, never anybody gained so far
upon me as yourself.&nbsp; With blushes I must own it, you have
shaken, as I may say, the very foundation of my honour.&nbsp;
Well, sure, if I escape your importunities, I shall value myself
as long as I live, I swear.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; And despise me.&nbsp; [<i>Sighing</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; The last of any man in the world, by my
purity; now you make me swear.&nbsp; O gratitude forbid, that I
should ever be wanting in a respectful acknowledgment of an
entire resignation of all my best wishes for the person and parts
of so accomplished a person, whose merit challenges much more,
I&rsquo;m sure, than my illiterate praises can description.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; [<i>In a whining tone</i>.]&nbsp; Ah heavens,
madam, you ruin me with kindness.&nbsp; Your charming tongue
pursues the victory of your eyes, while at your feet your poor
adorer dies.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Very fine.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; [<i>Still whining</i>.]&nbsp; Ah, why are you so
fair, so bewitching fair?&nbsp; O let me grow to the ground here,
and feast upon that hand; O let me press it to my heart, my
trembling heart: the nimble movement shall instruct your pulse,
and teach it to alarm desire.&nbsp; (Zoons, I&rsquo;m almost at
the end of my cant, if she does not yield quickly.)&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; O that&rsquo;s so passionate and fine, I
cannot hear.&nbsp; I am not safe if I stay, and must leave
you.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; And must you leave me!&nbsp; Rather let me
languish out a wretched life, and breath my soul beneath your
feet.&nbsp; (I must say the same thing over again, and
can&rsquo;t help it.)&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; I swear I&rsquo;m ready to languish
too!&nbsp; O my honour!&nbsp; Whither is it going?&nbsp; I
protest you have given me the palpitation of the heart.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Can you be so cruel&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; O rise, I beseech you, say no more till you
rise.&nbsp; Why did you kneel so long?&nbsp; I swear I was so
transported, I did not see it.&nbsp; Well, to show you how far
you have gained upon me, I assure you, if Sir Paul should die, of
all mankind there&rsquo;s none I&rsquo;d sooner make my second
choice.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; O Heaven!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t out-live this night
without your favour; I feel my spirits faint, a general dampness
overspreads my face, a cold deadly dew already vents through all
my pores, and will to-morrow wash me for ever from your sight,
and drown me in my tomb.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Oh, you have conquered, sweet, melting,
moving sir, you have conquered.&nbsp; What heart of marble can
refrain to weep, and yield to such sad sayings!&nbsp;
[<i>Cries</i>.]</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; I thank Heaven, they are the saddest that I ever
said.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; (I shall never contain laughter.)&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Oh, I yield myself all up to your
uncontrollable embraces.&nbsp; Say, thou dear dying man, when,
where, and how.&nbsp; Ah, there&rsquo;s Sir Paul.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; &rsquo;Slife, yonder&rsquo;s Sir Paul, but if he
were not come, I&rsquo;m so transported I cannot speak.&nbsp;
This note will inform you.&nbsp; [<i>Gives her a note</i>.]</p>
<h3>SCENE III.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Plyant</span>, <span
class="smcap">Sir Paul</span>, <span
class="smcap">Cynthia</span>.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Thou art my tender lambkin, and shalt do what
thou wilt.&nbsp; But endeavour to forget this Mellefont.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I would obey you to my power, sir; but if I have
not him, I have sworn never to marry.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Never to marry!&nbsp; Heavens forbid! must I
neither have sons nor grandsons?&nbsp; Must the family of the
Plyants be utterly extinct for want of issue male?&nbsp; O
impiety!&nbsp; But did you swear, did that sweet creature swear?
ha!&nbsp; How durst you swear without my consent, ah?&nbsp;
Gads-bud, who am I?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Pray don&rsquo;t be angry, sir, when I swore I had
your consent; and therefore I swore.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Why then the revoking my consent does annul,
or make of none effect your oath; so you may unswear it
again.&nbsp; The law will allow it.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Ay, but my conscience never will.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Gads-bud, no matter for that, conscience and
law never go together; you must not expect that.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Ay, but, Sir Paul, I conceive if she has
sworn, d&rsquo;ye mark me, if she has once sworn, it is most
unchristian, inhuman, and obscene that she should break it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll make up the match again, because Mr. Careless said it
would oblige him.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Does your ladyship conceive so?&nbsp; Why, I
was of that opinion once too.&nbsp; Nay, if your ladyship
conceives so, I&rsquo;m of that opinion again; but I can neither
find my lord nor my lady to know what they intend.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m satisfied that my cousin
Mellefont has been much wronged.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;m amazed to find her
of our side, for I&rsquo;m sure she loved him.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; I know my Lady Touchwood has no kindness
for him; and besides I have been informed by Mr. Careless, that
Mellefont had never anything more than a profound respect.&nbsp;
That he has owned himself to be my admirer &rsquo;tis true, but
he was never so presumptuous to entertain any dishonourable
notions of things; so that if this be made plain, I don&rsquo;t
see how my daughter can in conscience, or honour, or anything in
the world&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Indeed if this be made plain, as my lady, your
mother, says, child&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Plain!&nbsp; I was informed of it by Mr.
Careless.&nbsp; And I assure you, Mr. Careless is a person that
has a most extraordinary respect and honour for you, Sir
Paul.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; And for your ladyship too, I
believe, or else you had not changed sides so soon; now I begin
to find it.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; I am much obliged to Mr. Careless really; he
is a person that I have a great value for, not only for that, but
because he has a great veneration for your ladyship.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; O las, no indeed, Sir Paul, &rsquo;tis upon
your account.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; No, I protest and vow, I have no title to his
esteem, but in having the honour to appertain in some measure to
your ladyship, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; O law now, I swear and declare it
shan&rsquo;t be so; you&rsquo;re too modest, Sir Paul.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; It becomes me, when there is any comparison
made between&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; O fie, fie, Sir Paul, you&rsquo;ll put me
out of countenance.&nbsp; Your very obedient and affectionate
wife; that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; And highly honoured in that
title.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Gads-bud, I am transported!&nbsp; Give me
leave to kiss your ladyship&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; That my poor father should be so very silly!&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; My lip indeed, Sir Paul, I swear you
shall.&nbsp; [<i>He kisses her</i>, <i>and bows very
low</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; I humbly thank your ladyship.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know whether I fly on ground, or walk in air.&nbsp;
Gads-bud, she was never thus before.&nbsp; Well, I must own
myself the most beholden to Mr. Careless.&nbsp; As sure as can
be, this is all his doing, something that he has said; well,
&rsquo;tis a rare thing to have an ingenious friend.&nbsp; Well,
your ladyship is of opinion that the match may go forward.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; By all means.&nbsp; Mr. Careless has
satisfied me of the matter.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Well, why then, lamb, you may keep your oath,
but have a care about making rash vows; come hither to me, and
kiss papa.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; I swear and declare, I am in such a twitter
to read Mr. Careless his letter, that I can&rsquo;t forbear any
longer.&nbsp; But though I may read all letters first by
prerogative, yet I&rsquo;ll be sure to be unsuspected this time,
Sir Paul.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Did your ladyship call?</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Nay, not to interrupt you, my dear.&nbsp;
Only lend me your letter, which you had from your steward to-day;
I would look upon the account again, and may be increase your
allowance.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; There it is, madam, do you want a pen and
ink?&nbsp; [<i>Bows and gives the letter</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; No, no, nothing else, I thank you, Sir
Paul.&nbsp; So, now I can read my own letter under the cover of
his.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; He?&nbsp; And wilt thou bring a grandson at
nine months end&mdash;he?&nbsp; A brave chopping boy.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll settle a thousand pound a year upon the rogue as soon
as ever he looks me in the face, I will, gads-bud.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m overjoyed to think I have any of my family that will
bring children into the world.&nbsp; For I would fain have some
resemblance of myself in my posterity, he, Thy?&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t
you contrive that affair, girl?&nbsp; Do, gads-bud, think on thy
old father, heh?&nbsp; Make the young rogue as like as you
can.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad to see you so merry, sir.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Merry, gads-bud, I&rsquo;m serious; I&rsquo;ll
give thee five hundred pounds for every inch of him that
resembles me; ah, this eye, this left eye!&nbsp; A thousand
pounds for this left eye.&nbsp; This has done execution in its
time, girl; why, thou hast my leer, hussey, just thy
father&rsquo;s leer.&nbsp; Let it be transmitted to the young
rogue by the help of imagination; why, &rsquo;tis the mark of our
family, Thy; our house is distinguished by a languishing eye, as
the house of Austria is by a thick lip.&nbsp; Ah! when I was of
your age, hussey, I would have held fifty to one, I could have
drawn my own picture&mdash;gads-bud I could have done&mdash;not
so much as you, neither; but&mdash;nay, don&rsquo;t blush.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t blush, sir, for I vow I don&rsquo;t
understand.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Pshaw, pshaw, you fib, you baggage, you do
understand, and you shall understand; come, don&rsquo;t be so
nice.&nbsp; Gads-bud, don&rsquo;t learn after your mother-in-law
my lady here.&nbsp; Marry, heaven forbid that you should follow
her example; that would spoil all indeed.&nbsp; Bless us! if you
should take a vagary and make a rash resolution on your wedding
night, to die a maid, as she did; all were ruined, all my hopes
lost.&nbsp; My heart would break, and my estate would be left to
the wide world, he?&nbsp; I hope you are a better Christian than
to think of living a nun, he?&nbsp; Answer me?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m all obedience, sir, to your
commands.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; [<i>Having read the letter</i>.]&nbsp; O
dear Mr. Careless, I swear he writes charmingly, and he looks
charmingly, and he has charmed me, as much as I have charmed him;
and so I&rsquo;ll tell him in the wardrobe when &rsquo;tis
dark.&nbsp; O criminy!&nbsp; I hope Sir Paul has not seen both
letters.&nbsp; [<i>Puts the wrong letter hastily up</i>, <i>and
gives him her own</i>.]&nbsp; Sir Paul, here&rsquo;s your letter;
to-morrow morning I&rsquo;ll settle accounts to your
advantage.</p>
<h3>SCENE IV.</h3>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Brisk</span>.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Sir Paul, gads-bud, you&rsquo;re an uncivil
person, let me tell you, and all that; and I did not think it had
been in you.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; O law, what&rsquo;s the matter now?&nbsp; I
hope you are not angry, Mr. Brisk.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Deuce take me, I believe you intend to marry your
daughter yourself; you&rsquo;re always brooding over her like an
old hen, as if she were not well hatched, egad, he.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Good strange!&nbsp; Mr. Brisk is such a merry
facetious person, he, he, he.&nbsp; No, no, I have done with her,
I have done with her now.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; The fiddles have stayed this hour in the hall,
and my Lord Froth wants a partner, we can never begin without
her.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Go, go child, go, get you gone and dance and
be merry; I&rsquo;ll come and look at you by and by.&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s my son Mellefont?</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll send him to them, I know where
he is.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Sir Paul, will you send Careless into the hall if
you meet him?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; I will, I will, I&rsquo;ll go and look for him
on purpose.</p>
<h3>SCENE V.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Brisk</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; So now they are all gone, and I have an
opportunity to practice.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; My dear Lady Froth,
she&rsquo;s a most engaging creature, if she were not so fond of
that damned coxcombly lord of hers; and yet I am forced to allow
him wit too, to keep in with him.&nbsp; No matter, she&rsquo;s a
woman of parts, and, egad, parts will carry her.&nbsp; She said
she would follow me into the gallery.&nbsp; Now to make my
approaches.&nbsp; Hem, hem!&nbsp; Ah ma- [<i>bows</i>.]
dam!&nbsp; Pox on&rsquo;t, why should I disparage my parts by
thinking what to say?&nbsp; None but dull rogues think; witty
men, like rich fellows, are always ready for all expenses; while
your blockheads, like poor needy scoundrels, are forced to
examine their stock, and forecast the charges of the day.&nbsp;
Here she comes, I&rsquo;ll seem not to see her, and try to win
her with a new airy invention of my own, hem!</p>

humble servant.&nbsp; The matter, madam?&nbsp; Nothing, madam,
nothing at all, egad.&nbsp; I was fallen into the most agreeable
amusement in the whole province of contemplation: that&rsquo;s
all&mdash;(I&rsquo;ll seem to conceal my passion, and that will
look like respect.)&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Bless me, why did you call out upon me so
loud?</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; O Lord, I, madam!&nbsp; I beseech your
ladyship&mdash;when?</p>

don&rsquo;t you know it?</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Not I, let me perish.&nbsp; But did I?&nbsp;
Strange!&nbsp; I confess your ladyship was in my thoughts; and I
was in a sort of dream that did in a manner represent a very
pleasing object to my imagination, but&mdash;but did I
indeed?&mdash;To see how love and murder will out.&nbsp; But did
I really name my Lady Froth?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Three times aloud, as I love letters.&nbsp;
But did you talk of love?&nbsp; O Parnassus!&nbsp; Who would have
thought Mr. Brisk could have been in love, ha, ha, ha.&nbsp; O
heavens, I thought you could have no mistress but the Nine
Muses.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; No more I have, egad, for I adore &rsquo;em all

to be splenetic, or airy upon&rsquo;t; the deuce take me if I can

myself, ha, ha, ha; yet by heavens, I have a violent passion for
your ladyship, seriously.</p>

<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; The company are all ready.&nbsp; How
now?</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Zoons! madam, there&rsquo;s my lord.&nbsp;
[<i>Softly to her</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Take no notice, but observe me.&nbsp; Now,
cast off, and meet me at the lower end of the room, and then join
hands again; I could teach my lord this dance purely, but I vow,
Mr. Brisk, I can&rsquo;t tell how to come so near any other
man.&nbsp; Oh here&rsquo;s my lord, now you shall see me do it
with him.&nbsp; [<i>They pretend to practise part of a country
dance</i>.]</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, I see there&rsquo;s no harm yet, but I
don&rsquo;t like this familiarity.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Shall you and I do our close dance, to show
Mr. Brisk?</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; No, my dear, do it with him.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll do it with him, my lord, when you
are out of the way.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s good, egad, that&rsquo;s good.&nbsp;
Deuce take me, I can hardly hold laughing in his face.&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Any other time, my dear, or we&rsquo;ll
dance it below.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; With all my heart.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Come, my lord, I&rsquo;ll wait on you.&nbsp; My
charming witty angel!&nbsp; [<i>To her</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; We shall have whispering time enough, you
know, since we are partners.</p>
<h3>SCENE VIII.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Plyant</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Careless</span>.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Oh, Mr. Careless, Mr. Careless, I&rsquo;m
ruined, I&rsquo;m undone.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter, madam?</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Oh, the unluckiest accident, I&rsquo;m
afraid I shan&rsquo;t live to tell it you.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Heaven forbid!&nbsp; What is it?</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m in such a fright; the strangest
quandary and premunire!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m all over in a universal
agitation; I dare swear every circumstance of me trembles.&nbsp;
O your letter, your letter!&nbsp; By an unfortunate mistake I
have given Sir Paul your letter instead of his own.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; That was unlucky.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Oh, yonder he comes reading of it; for
heaven&rsquo;s sake step in here and advise me quickly before he
sees.</p>
<h3>SCENE IX.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir Paul</span> <i>with the
Letter</i>.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; O Providence, what a conspiracy have I
discovered.&nbsp; But let me see to make an end on&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
[<i>Reads</i>.]&nbsp; Hum&mdash;After supper in the wardrobe by
the gallery.&nbsp; If Sir Paul should surprise us, I have a
commission from him to treat with you about the very matter of
fact.&nbsp; Matter of fact!&nbsp; Very pretty; it seems that I am
conducting to my own cuckoldom.&nbsp; Why, this is the very
traitorous position of taking up arms by my authority, against my
person!&nbsp; Well, let me see.&nbsp; Till then I languish in
expectation of my adored charmer.&mdash;Dying Ned Careless.&nbsp;
Gads-bud, would that were matter of fact too.&nbsp; Die and be
damned for a Judas Maccabeus and Iscariot both.&nbsp; O
friendship! what art thou but a name?&nbsp; Henceforward let no
man make a friend that would not be a cuckold: for whomsoever he
receives into his bosom will find the way to his bed, and there
return his caresses with interest to his wife.&nbsp; Have I for
this been pinioned, night after night for three years past?&nbsp;
Have I been swathed in blankets till I have been even deprived of
motion?&nbsp; Have I approached the marriage bed with reverence
as to a sacred shrine, and denied myself the enjoyment of lawful
domestic pleasures to preserve its purity, and must I now find it
polluted by foreign iniquity?&nbsp; O my Lady Plyant, you were
chaste as ice, but you are melted now, and false as water.&nbsp;
But Providence has been constant to me in discovering this
conspiracy; still, I am beholden to Providence.&nbsp; If it were
not for Providence, sure, poor Sir Paul, thy heart would
break.</p>
<h3>SCENE X.</h3>
<p>[<i>To him</i>] <span class="smcap">Lady Plyant</span>.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; So, sir, I see you have read the
letter.&nbsp; Well, now, Sir Paul, what do you think of your
friend Careless?&nbsp; Has he been treacherous, or did you give
his insolence a licence to make trial of your wife&rsquo;s
suspected virtue?&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye see here?&nbsp; [<i>Snatches
the letter as in anger</i>.]&nbsp; Look, read it.&nbsp; Gads my
life, if I thought it were so, I would this moment renounce all
communication with you.&nbsp; Ungrateful monster!&nbsp; He? is it
so?&nbsp; Ay, I see it, a plot upon my honour; your guilty cheeks
confess it.&nbsp; Oh, where shall wronged virtue fly for
reparation?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be divorced this instant.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Gads-bud, what shall I say?&nbsp; This is the
strangest surprise.&nbsp; Why, I don&rsquo;t know anything at
all, nor I don&rsquo;t know whether there be anything at all in
the world, or no.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; I thought I should try you, false
man.&nbsp; I, that never dissembled in my life, yet to make trial
of you, pretended to like that monster of iniquity, Careless, and
found out that contrivance to let you see this letter, which now
I find was of your own inditing&mdash;I do, heathen, I do.&nbsp;
See my face no more; I&rsquo;ll be divorced presently.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; O strange, what will become of me?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m so amazed, and so overjoyed, so afraid, and so
sorry.&nbsp; But did you give me this letter on purpose,
he?&nbsp; Did you?</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Did I?&nbsp; Do you doubt me, Turk,
Saracen?&nbsp; I have a cousin that&rsquo;s a proctor in the
Commons; I&rsquo;ll go to him instantly.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Hold, stay, I beseech your ladyship.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m so overjoyed, stay, I&rsquo;ll confess all.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; What will you confess, Jew?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Why, now, as I hope to be saved, I had no hand
in this letter&mdash;nay, hear me, I beseech your ladyship.&nbsp;
The devil take me now if he did not go beyond my
commission.&nbsp; If I desired him to do any more than speak a
good word only just for me; gads-bud, only for poor Sir Paul,
I&rsquo;m an Anabaptist, or a Jew, or what you please to call
me.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Why, is not here matter of fact?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Ay, but by your own virtue and continency that
matter of fact is all his own doing.&nbsp; I confess I had a
great desire to have some honours conferred upon me, which lie
all in your ladyship&rsquo;s breast, and he being a well-spoken
man, I desired him to intercede for me.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Did you so? presumption!&nbsp; Oh, he
comes, the Tarquin comes; I cannot bear his sight.</p>
<h3>SCENE XI.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Careless</span>, <span class="smcap">Sir
Paul</span>.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Sir Paul, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve met with you,
&rsquo;gad, I have said all I could, but can&rsquo;t
prevail.&nbsp; Then my friendship to you has carried me a little
farther in this matter.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Indeed; well sir, I&rsquo;ll dissemble with
him a little.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Why, faith I have in my time known honest
gentlemen abused by a pretended coyness in their wives, and I had
a mind to try my lady&rsquo;s virtue.&nbsp; And when I could not
prevail for you, gad, I pretended to be in love myself; but all
in vain, she would not hear a word upon that subject.&nbsp; Then
I writ a letter to her; I don&rsquo;t know what effects that will
have, but I&rsquo;ll be sure to tell you when I do, though by
this light I believe her virtue is impregnable.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; O Providence!&nbsp; Providence!&nbsp; What
discoveries are here made?&nbsp; Why, this is better and more
miraculous than the rest.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; What do you mean?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell you, I&rsquo;m so
overjoyed; come along with me to my lady, I can&rsquo;t contain
myself; come, my dear friend.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; So, so, so, this difficulty&rsquo;s over.&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<h3>SCENE XII.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mellefont</span>, <span
class="smcap">Maskwell</span>, <i>from different doors</i>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Maskwell!&nbsp; I have been looking for
you&mdash;&rsquo;tis within a quarter of eight.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; My lady is just gone into my lord&rsquo;s closet,
you had best steal into her chamber before she comes, and lie
concealed there, otherwise she may lock the door when we are
together, and you not easily get in to surprise us.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; He?&nbsp; You say true.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; You had best make haste, for after she has made
some apology to the company for her own and my lord&rsquo;s
absence all this while, she&rsquo;ll retire to her chamber
instantly.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; I go this moment.&nbsp; Now, fortune, I defy
thee.</p>
<h3>SCENE XIII.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Maskwell</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I confess you may be allowed to be secure in your
own opinion; the appearance is very fair, but I have an
after-game to play that shall turn the tables, and here comes the
man that I must manage.</p>
<h3>SCENE XIV.</h3>
<p>[<i>To him</i>] <span class="smcap">Lord Touchwood</span>.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Maskwell, you are the man I wished to
meet.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I am happy to be in the way of your
lordship&rsquo;s commands.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I have always found you prudent and careful
in anything that has concerned me or my family.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I were a villain else.&nbsp; I am bound by duty
and gratitude, and my own inclination, to be ever your
lordship&rsquo;s servant.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Enough.&nbsp; You are my friend; I know
it.&nbsp; Yet there has been a thing in your knowledge, which has
concerned me nearly, that you have concealed from me.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; My lord!</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Nay, I excuse your friendship to my
unnatural nephew thus far.&nbsp; But I know you have been privy
to his impious designs upon my wife.&nbsp; This evening she has
told me all.&nbsp; Her good nature concealed it as long as was
possible; but he perseveres so in villainy, that she has told me
even you were weary of dissuading him, though you have once
actually hindered him from forcing her.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I am sorry, my lord, I can&rsquo;t make you an
answer; this is an occasion in which I would not willing be
silent.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I know you would excuse him&mdash;and I know
as well that you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Indeed I was in hopes it had been a youthful heat
that might have soon boiled over; but&mdash;</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Say on.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I have nothing more to say, my lord; but to
express my concern; for I think his frenzy increases daily.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; How!&nbsp; Give me but proof of it, ocular
proof, that I may justify my dealing with him to the world, and
share my fortunes.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; O my lord! consider; that is hard.&nbsp; Besides,
time may work upon him.&nbsp; Then, for me to do it!&nbsp; I have
professed an everlasting friendship to him.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; He is your friend; and what am I?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I am answered.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Fear not his displeasure; I will put you out
of his, and fortune&rsquo;s power, and for that thou art
scrupulously honest, I will secure thy fidelity to him, and give
my honour never to own any discovery that you shall make
me.&nbsp; Can you give me a demonstrative proof?&nbsp; Speak.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I wish I could not.&nbsp; To be plain, my lord, I
intended this evening to have tried all arguments to dissuade him
from a design which I suspect; and if I had not succeeded, to
have informed your lordship of what I knew.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I thank you.&nbsp; What is the
villain&rsquo;s purpose?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; He has owned nothing to me of late, and what I
mean now, is only a bare suspicion of my own.&nbsp; If your
lordship will meet me a quarter of an hour hence there, in that
lobby by my lady&rsquo;s bed-chamber, I shall be able to tell you
more.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I will.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; My duty to your lordship makes me do a severe
piece of justice.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I will be secret, and reward your honesty
beyond your hopes.</p>

<p><i>Scene opening</i>, <i>shows Lady Touchwood&rsquo;s
chamber</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mellefont</span> <i>solus</i>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Pray heaven my aunt keep touch with her
assignation.&nbsp; O that her lord were but sweating behind this
hanging, with the expectation of what I shall see.&nbsp; Hist,
she comes.&nbsp; Little does she think what a mine is just ready
to spring under her feet.&nbsp; But to my post.&nbsp; [<i>Goes
behind the hangings</i>.]</p>
<h3>SCENE XVI.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span>.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis eight o&rsquo;clock; methinks I
should have found him here.&nbsp; Who does not prevent the hour
of love, outstays the time; for to be dully punctual is too
slow.&nbsp; I was accusing you of neglect.</p>
<h3>SCENE XVII.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span>, <span
class="smcap">Maskwell</span>, <span
class="smcap">Mellefont</span> <i>absconding</i>.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I confess you do reproach me when I see you here
before me; but &rsquo;tis fit I should be still behindhand, still
to be more and more indebted to your goodness.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; You can excuse a fault too well, not to have
been to blame.&nbsp; A ready answer shows you were prepared.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Guilt is ever at a loss, and confusion waits upon
it; when innocence and bold truth are always ready for
expression.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Not in love: words are the weak support of
cold indifference; love has no language to be heard.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Excess of joy has made me stupid!&nbsp; Thus may
my lips be ever closed.&nbsp; [<i>Kisses her</i>.]&nbsp; And
thus&mdash;O who would not lose his speech, upon condition to
have joys above it?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Hold, let me lock the door first.&nbsp;
[<i>Goes to the door</i>.]</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; That I believed; &rsquo;twas
well I left the private passage open.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; So, that&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; And so may all your pleasures be, and secret as
this kiss&mdash;</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; And may all treachery be thus discovered.&nbsp;
[<i>Leaps out</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; [<i>Shrieks</i>.]</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Villain!&nbsp; [<i>Offers to draw</i>.]</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Nay, then, there&rsquo;s but one way.&nbsp;
[<i>Runs out</i>.]</p>
<h3>SCENE XVIII.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span>, <span
class="smcap">Mellefont</span>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Say you so, were you provided for an escape?&nbsp;
Hold, madam, you have no more holes to your burrow; I&rsquo;ll
stand between you and this sally-port.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Thunder strike thee dead for this deceit,
immediate lightning blast thee, me, and the whole world!&nbsp;
Oh!&nbsp; I could rack myself, play the vulture to my own heart,
and gnaw it piecemeal, for not boding to me this misfortune.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Be patient.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Be damned.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Consider, I have you on the hook; you will but
flounder yourself a-weary, and be nevertheless my prisoner.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll hold my breath and die, but
I&rsquo;ll be free.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; O madam, have a care of dying unprepared, I doubt
you have some unrepented sins that may hang heavy, and retard
your flight.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; O! what shall I do? say?&nbsp; Whither shall
I turn?&nbsp; Has hell no remedy?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; None; hell has served you even as heaven has done,
left you to yourself.&mdash;You&rsquo;re in a kind of Erasmus
paradise, yet if you please you may make it a purgatory; and with
a little penance and my absolution all this may turn to good
account.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Hold in my passion,
and fall, fall a little, thou swelling heart; let me have some
intermission of this rage, and one minute&rsquo;s coolness to
dissemble.&nbsp; [<i>She weeps</i>.]</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; You have been to blame.&nbsp; I like those tears,
and hope they are of the purest kind,&mdash;penitential
tears.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; O the scene was shifted quick before
me,&mdash;I had not time to think.&nbsp; I was surprised to see a
monster in the glass, and now I find &rsquo;tis myself; can you
have mercy to forgive the faults I have imagined, but never put
in practice?&mdash;O consider, consider how fatal you have been
to me, you have already killed the quiet of this life.&nbsp; The
love of you was the first wandering fire that e&rsquo;er misled
my steps, and while I had only that in view, I was betrayed into
unthought of ways of ruin.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; May I believe this true?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; O be not cruelly incredulous.&mdash;How can
you doubt these streaming eyes?&nbsp; Keep the severest eye
o&rsquo;er all my future conduct, and if I once relapse, let me
not hope forgiveness; &rsquo;twill ever be in your power to ruin
me.&nbsp; My lord shall sign to your desires; I will myself
create your happiness, and Cynthia shall be this night your
bride.&nbsp; Do but conceal my failings, and forgive.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Upon such terms I will be ever yours in every
honest way.</p>

o&rsquo;erpaid me all, all! all&rsquo;s my own!&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Nay, I beseech you rise.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; [<i>Aloud</i>.]&nbsp; Never, never!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll grow to the ground, be buried quick beneath it,
e&rsquo;er I&rsquo;ll be consenting to so damned a sin as incest!
unnatural incest!</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Ha!</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; O cruel man, will you not let me go?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll forgive all that&rsquo;s past.&nbsp; O heaven, you
will not ravish me?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Damnation!</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Monster, dog! your life shall answer
this!&nbsp; [<i>Draws and runs at</i> <span

<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; O heavens, my lord!&nbsp; Hold, hold, for
heaven&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Confusion, my uncle!&nbsp; O the damned
sorceress.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Moderate your rage, good my lord!&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s mad, alas, he&rsquo;s mad.&nbsp; Indeed he is, my
lord, and knows not what he does.&nbsp; See how wild he
looks.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; By heaven, &rsquo;twere senseless not to be mad,
and see such witchcraft.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; My lord, you hear him, he talks idly.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Hence from my sight, thou living infamy to
my name; when next I see that face, I&rsquo;ll write villain
in&rsquo;t with my sword&rsquo;s point.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Now, by my soul, I will not go till I have made
known my wrongs.&nbsp; Nay, till I have made known yours, which,
if possible, are greater,&mdash;though she has all the host of
hell her servants.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Alas, he raves!&nbsp; Talks very
poetry!&nbsp; For heaven&rsquo;s sake away, my lord, he&rsquo;ll
either tempt you to extravagance, or commit some himself.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Death and furies, will you not hear me?&mdash;Why
by heaven she laughs, grins, points to your back; she forks out
cuckoldom with her fingers, and you&rsquo;re running horn-mad
after your fortune.&nbsp; [<i>As she is going she turns back and
smiles at him</i>.]</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I fear he&rsquo;s mad
indeed.&mdash;Let&rsquo;s send Maskwell to him.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Send him to her.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Come, come, good my lord, my heart aches so,
I shall faint if I stay.</p>
<h3>SCENE XXI.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mellefont</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Oh, I could curse my stars, fate, and chance; all
causes and accidents of fortune in this life!&nbsp; But to what
purpose?&nbsp; Yet, &rsquo;sdeath, for a man to have the fruit of
all his industry grow full and ripe, ready to drop into his
mouth, and just when he holds out his hand to gather it, to have
a sudden whirlwind come, tear up tree and all, and bear away the
very root and foundation of his hopes:&mdash;what temper can
contain?&nbsp; They talk of sending Maskwell to me; I never had
more need of him.&nbsp; But what can he do?&nbsp; Imagination
cannot form a fairer and more plausible design than this of his
which has miscarried.&nbsp; O my precious aunt, I shall never
thrive without I deal with the devil, or another woman.</p>
<p>Women, like flames, have a destroying power,</p>
<p>Ne&rsquo;er to be quenched, till they themselves devour.</p>
<h2>ACT V.</h2>
<h3>SCENE I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span> <i>and</i> <span

<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Was&rsquo;t not lucky?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Lucky!&nbsp; Fortune is your own, and &rsquo;tis
her interest so to be.&nbsp; By heaven I believe you can control
her power, and she fears it: though chance brought my lord,
&rsquo;twas your own art that turned it to advantage.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true it might have been my
ruin.&nbsp; But yonder&rsquo;s my lord.&nbsp; I believe
he&rsquo;s coming to find you: I&rsquo;ll not be seen.</p>
<h3>SCENE II.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Maskwell</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; So; I durst not own my introducing my lord, though
it succeeded well for her, for she would have suspected a design
which I should have been puzzled to excuse.&nbsp; My lord is
thoughtful.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be so too; yet he shall know my
thoughts: or think he does.</p>
<h3>SCENE III.</h3>
<p>[<i>To him</i>] <span class="smcap">Lord Touchwood</span>.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; What have I done?</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Talking to himself!</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas honest&mdash;and shall I be rewarded
for it?&nbsp; No, &rsquo;twas honest, therefore I
shan&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Nay, rather therefore I ought not; for it
rewards itself.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Unequalled virtue!&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; But should it be known, then I have lost a
friend!&nbsp; He was an ill man, and I have gained; for half
myself I lent him, and that I have recalled: so I have served
myself, and what is yet better, I have served a worthy lord to
whom I owe myself.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Excellent man!&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Yet I am wretched.&nbsp; Oh, there is a secret
burns within this breast, which, should it once blaze forth,
would ruin all, consume my honest character, and brand me with
the name of villain.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Ha!</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Why do I love!&nbsp; Yet heaven and my waking
conscience are my witnesses, I never gave one working thought a
vent, which might discover that I loved, nor ever must.&nbsp; No,
let it prey upon my heart; for I would rather die, than seem
once, barely seem, dishonest.&nbsp; Oh, should it once be known I
love fair Cynthia, all this that I have done would look like
rival&rsquo;s malice, false friendship to my lord, and base
self-interest.&nbsp; Let me perish first, and from this hour
avoid all sight and speech, and, if I can, all thought of that
pernicious beauty.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; But what is my distraction
doing?&nbsp; I am wildly talking to myself, and some ill chance
might have directed malicious ears this way.&nbsp; [<i>Seems to
start</i>, <i>seeing my lord</i>.]</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Start not; let guilty and dishonest souls
start at the revelation of their thoughts, but be thou fixed, as
is thy virtue.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I am confounded, and beg your Lordship&rsquo;s
pardon for those free discourses which I have had with
myself.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Come, I beg your pardon that I overheard
you, and yet it shall not need.&nbsp; Honest Maskwell!&nbsp; Thy
and my good genius led me hither.&nbsp; Mine, in that I have
discovered so much manly virtue; thine, in that thou shalt have
due reward of all thy worth.&nbsp; Give me thy hand.&nbsp; My
nephew is the alone remaining branch of all our ancient family:
him I thus blow away, and constitute thee in his room to be my
heir&mdash;</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Now heaven forbid&mdash;</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; No more&mdash;I have resolved.&nbsp; The
writings are ready drawn, and wanted nothing but to be signed,
and have his name inserted.&nbsp; Yours will fill the blank as
well.&nbsp; I will have no reply.&nbsp; Let me command this time;
for &rsquo;tis the last in which I will assume authority.&nbsp;
Hereafter, you shall rule where I have power.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I humbly would petition&mdash;</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Is&rsquo;t for yourself?&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">Maskwell</span> <i>pauses</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
hear of nought for anybody else.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Then witness heaven for me, this wealth and honour
was not of my seeking, nor would I build my fortune on
another&rsquo;s ruin.&nbsp; I had but one desire&mdash;</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Thou shalt enjoy it.&nbsp; If all I&rsquo;m
worth in wealth or interest can purchase Cynthia, she is
thine.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure Sir Paul&rsquo;s consent will follow
fortune.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll quickly show him which way that is
going.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; You oppress me with bounty.&nbsp; My gratitude is
weak, and shrinks beneath the weight, and cannot rise to thank
you.&nbsp; What, enjoy my love!&nbsp; Forgive the transports of a
blessing so unexpected, so unhoped for, so unthought of!</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I will confirm it, and rejoice with
thee.</p>
<h3>SCENE IV.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Maskwell</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; This is prosperous indeed.&nbsp; Why let him find
me out a villain, settled in possession of a fair estate, and
full fruition of my love, I&rsquo;ll bear the railings of a
losing gamester.&nbsp; But should he find me out before!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis dangerous to delay.&nbsp; Let me think.&nbsp; Should
my lord proceed to treat openly of my marriage with Cynthia, all
must be discovered, and Mellefont can be no longer blinded.&nbsp;
It must not be; nay, should my lady know it&mdash;ay, then were
fine work indeed!&nbsp; Her fury would spare nothing, though she
involved herself in ruin.&nbsp; No, it must be by
stratagem.&nbsp; I must deceive Mellefont once more, and get my
lord to consent to my private management.&nbsp; He comes
opportunely.&nbsp; Now will I, in my old way, discover the whole
and real truth of the matter to him, that he may not suspect one
word on&rsquo;t.</p>
<blockquote><p>No mask like open truth to cover lies,<br />
As to go naked is the best disguise.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>SCENE V.</h3>
<p>[<i>To him</i>] <span class="smcap">Mellefont</span>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; O Maskwell, what hopes?&nbsp; I am confounded in a
maze of thoughts, each leading into one another, and all ending
in perplexity.&nbsp; My uncle will not see nor hear me.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; No matter, sir, don&rsquo;t trouble your head:
all&rsquo;s in my power.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; For heaven&rsquo;s sake?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Little do you think that your aunt has kept her
word.&nbsp; How the devil she wrought my lord into this dotage, I
know not; but he&rsquo;s gone to Sir Paul about my marriage with
Cynthia, and has appointed me his heir.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; The devil he has!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s to be
done?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I have it, it must be by stratagem; for it&rsquo;s
in vain to make application to him.&nbsp; I think I have that in
my head that cannot fail.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s Cynthia?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; In the garden.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Let us go and consult her: my life for yours, I
cheat my lord.</p>
<h3>SCENE VI.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Touchwood</span>, <span
class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span>.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Maskwell your heir, and marry Cynthia!</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I cannot do too much for so much merit.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; But this is a thing of too great moment to
be so suddenly resolved.&nbsp; Why Cynthia?&nbsp; Why must he be
married?&nbsp; Is there not reward enough in raising his low
fortune, but he must mix his blood with mine, and wed my
niece?&nbsp; How know you that my brother will consent, or
she?&nbsp; Nay, he himself perhaps may have affections
otherwhere.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; No, I am convinced he loves her.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Maskwell love Cynthia?&nbsp; Impossible!</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I tell you he confessed it to me.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Confusion!&nbsp; How&rsquo;s this?&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; His humility long stifled his passion.&nbsp;
And his love of Mellefont would have made him still conceal
it.&nbsp; But by encouragement, I wrung the secret from him, and
know he&rsquo;s no way to be rewarded but in her.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll defer my farther proceedings in it till you have
considered it; but remember how we are both indebted to him.</p>
<h3>SCENE VII.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Both indebted to him!&nbsp; Yes, we are both
indebted to him, if you knew all.&nbsp; Villain!&nbsp; Oh, I am
wild with this surprise of treachery: it is impossible, it cannot
be.&nbsp; He love Cynthia!&nbsp; What, have I been bawd to his
designs, his property only, a baiting place?&nbsp; Now I see what
made him false to Mellefont.&nbsp; Shame and distraction!&nbsp; I
cannot bear it, oh! what woman can bear to be a property?&nbsp;
To be kindled to a flame, only to light him to another&rsquo;s
arms; oh! that I were fire indeed that I might burn the vile
traitor.&nbsp; What shall I do?&nbsp; How shall I think?&nbsp; I
cannot think.&nbsp; All my designs are lost, my love unsated, my
revenge unfinished, and fresh cause of fury from unthought of
plagues.</p>
<h3>SCENE VIII.</h3>
<p>[<i>To her</i>] <span class="smcap">Sir Paul</span>.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Madam, sister, my lady sister, did you see my
lady my wife?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Torture!</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Gads-bud, I can&rsquo;t find her high nor low;
where can she be, think you?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Where she&rsquo;s serving you, as all your
sex ought to be served, making you a beast.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
know you&rsquo;re a fool, brother?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; A fool; he, he, he, you&rsquo;re merry.&nbsp;
No, no, not I, I know no such matter.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Why, then, you don&rsquo;t know half your
happiness.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a jest with all my heart, faith
and troth.&nbsp; But harkee, my lord told me something of a
revolution of things; I don&rsquo;t know what to make
on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Gads-bud, I must consult my wife:&mdash;he
talks of disinheriting his nephew, and I don&rsquo;t know
what.&nbsp; Look you, sister, I must know what my girl has to
trust to, or not a syllable of a wedding, gads-bud!&mdash;to show
you that I am not a fool.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Hear me: consent to the breaking off this
marriage, and the promoting any other without consulting me, and
I&rsquo;ll renounce all blood, all relation and concern with you
for ever; nay, I&rsquo;ll be your enemy, and pursue you to
destruction: I&rsquo;ll tear your eyes out, and tread you under
my feet.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Why, what&rsquo;s the matter now?&nbsp; Good
Lord, what&rsquo;s all this for?&nbsp; Pooh, here&rsquo;s a joke
indeed.&nbsp; Why, where&rsquo;s my wife?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; With Careless, in the close arbour; he may
want you by this time, as much as you want her.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Oh, if she be with Mr. Careless, &rsquo;tis
well enough.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Fool, sot, insensible ox!&nbsp; But remember
what I said to you, or you had better eat your own horns, by this
light you had.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a passionate woman,
gads-bud!&nbsp; But to say truth all our family are choleric; I
am the only peaceable person amongst &rsquo;em.</p>
<h3>SCENE IX.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mellefont</span>, <span
class="smcap">Maskwell</span>, <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Cynthia</span>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; I know no other way but this he has proposed: if
you have love enough to run the venture.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether I have love enough, but
I find I have obstinacy enough to pursue whatever I have once
resolved; and a true female courage to oppose anything that
resists my will, though &rsquo;twere reason itself.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll secure
the writings and run the hazard along with you.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; But how can the coach and six horses be got ready
without suspicion?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Leave it to my care; that shall be so far from
being suspected, that it shall be got ready by my lord&rsquo;s
own order.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; How?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Why, I intend to tell my lord the whole matter of
our contrivance; that&rsquo;s my way.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t understand you.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ll tell my lord I laid this plot with
you on purpose to betray you; and that which put me upon it, was
the finding it impossible to gain the lady any other way, but in
the hopes of her marrying you.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; So.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; So, why so, while you&rsquo;re busied in making
yourself ready, I&rsquo;ll wheedle her into the coach; and
instead of you, borrow my lord&rsquo;s chaplain, and so run away
with her myself.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Oh, I conceive you; you&rsquo;ll tell him so.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Tell him so! ay; why, you don&rsquo;t think I mean
to do so?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; No, no; ha, ha, I dare swear thou wilt not.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Therefore, for our farther security, I would have
you disguised like a parson, that if my lord should have
curiosity to peep, he may not discover you in the coach, but
think the cheat is carried on as he would have it.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Excellent Maskwell!&nbsp; Thou wert certainly meant
for a statesman or a Jesuit; but thou art too honest for one, and
too pious for the other.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Well, get yourself ready, and meet me in
half-an-hour, yonder in my lady&rsquo;s dressing-room; go by the
back stairs, and so we may slip down without being
observed.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll send the chaplain to you with his
robes: I have made him my own, and ordered him to meet us
to-morrow morning at St. Albans; there we will sum up this
account, to all our satisfactions.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Should I begin to thank or praise thee, I should
waste the little time we have.</p>
<h3>SCENE X.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia</span>, <span
class="smcap">Maskwell</span>.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Madam, you will be ready?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I will be punctual to the minute.&nbsp;
[<i>Going</i>.]</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Stay, I have a doubt.&nbsp; Upon second thoughts,
we had better meet in the chaplain&rsquo;s chamber here, the
corner chamber at this end of the gallery, there is a back way
into it, so that you need not come through this door, and a pair
of private stairs leading down to the stables.&nbsp; It will be
more convenient.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I am guided by you; but Mellefont will
mistake.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; No, no, I&rsquo;ll after him immediately, and tell
him.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I will not fail.</p>
<h3>SCENE XI.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Maskwell</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Why, <i>qui vult decipi
decipiatur</i>.&mdash;&rsquo;Tis no fault of mine: I have told
&rsquo;em in plain terms how easy &rsquo;tis for me to cheat
&rsquo;em, and if they will not hear the serpent&rsquo;s hiss,
they must be stung into experience and future caution.&nbsp; Now
to prepare my lord to consent to this.&nbsp; But first I must
instruct my little Levite; there is no plot, public or private,
that can expect to prosper without one of them has a finger
in&rsquo;t: he promised me to be within at this hour,&mdash;Mr.
Saygrace, Mr. Saygrace!&nbsp; [<i>Goes to the chamber door and
knocks</i>.]</p>
<h3>SCENE XII.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Maskwell</span>, <span
class="smcap">Saygrace</span>.</p>
<p>SAYGRACE [<i>looking out</i>.]&nbsp; Sweet sir, I will but pen
the last line of an acrostic, and be with you in the twinkling of
an ejaculation, in the pronouncing of an Amen, or before you
can&mdash;</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Nay, good Mr. Saygrace, do not prolong the time by
describing to me the shortness of your stay; rather if you
please, defer the finishing of your wit, and let us talk about
our business; it shall be tithes in your way.</p>
<p>SAYGRACE.&nbsp; [<i>Enters</i>.]&nbsp; You shall prevail: I
would break off in the middle of a sermon to do you a
pleasure.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; You could not do me a greater,&mdash;except the
business in hand.&nbsp; Have you provided a habit for
Mellefont?</p>
<p>SAYGRACE.&nbsp; I have; they are ready in my chamber, together
with a clean starched band and cuffs.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Good, let them be carried to him; have you
stitched the gown sleeve, that he may be puzzled, and waste time
in putting it on?</p>
<p>SAYGRACE.&nbsp; I have: the gown will not be indued without
perplexity.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Meet me in half-an-hour, here in your own
chamber.&nbsp; When Cynthia comes, let there be no light, and do
not speak, that she may not distinguish you from Mellefont.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll urge haste to excuse your silence.</p>
<p>SAYGRACE.&nbsp; You have no more commands?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; None: your text is short.</p>
<p>SAYGRACE.&nbsp; But pithy: and I will handle it with
discretion.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; It will be the first you have so served.</p>
<h3>SCENE XIII.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Touchwood</span>, <span
class="smcap">Maskwell</span>.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Sure I was born to be controlled by those I
should command.&nbsp; My very slaves will shortly give me rules
how I shall govern them.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I am concerned to see your lordship
discomposed.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Have you seen my wife lately, or disobliged
her?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; No, my lord.&nbsp; What can this mean?&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Then Mellefont has urged somebody to incense
her.&nbsp; Something she has heard of you which carries her
beyond the bounds of patience.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; This I feared.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Did not
your lordship tell her of the honours you designed me?</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis that; you know my lady has a high
spirit; she thinks I am unworthy.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Unworthy!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an ignorant pride
in her to think so.&nbsp; Honesty to me is true nobility.&nbsp;
However, &rsquo;tis my will it shall be so, and that should be
convincing to her as much as reason.&nbsp; By Heaven, I&rsquo;ll
not be wife-ridden; were it possible, it should be done this
night.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; By Heaven, he meets my wishes!&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Few things are impossible to willing
minds.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Instruct me how this may be done, you shall
see I want no inclination.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I had laid a small design for to-morrow (as love
will be inventing) which I thought to communicate to your
lordship.&nbsp; But it may be as well done to-night.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s company.&nbsp; Come this way
and tell me.</p>
<h3>SCENE XIV.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Careless</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Cynthia</span>.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Is not that he now gone out with my lord?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; By heaven, there&rsquo;s treachery.&nbsp; The
confusion that I saw your father in, my Lady Touchwood&rsquo;s
passion, with what imperfectly I overheard between my lord and
her, confirm me in my fears.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s Mellefont?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Here he comes.</p>
<h3>SCENE XV.</h3>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Mellefont</span>.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Did Maskwell tell you anything of the
chaplain&rsquo;s chamber?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; My dear, will you get ready?&nbsp; The
things are all in my chamber; I want nothing but the habit.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; You are betrayed, and Maskwell is the villain I
always thought him.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; When you were gone, he said his mind was changed,
and bid me meet him in the chaplain&rsquo;s room, pretending
immediately to follow you and give you notice.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; How?</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Saygrace tripping by with a bundle
under his arm.&nbsp; He cannot be ignorant that Maskwell means to
use his chamber; let&rsquo;s follow and examine him.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis loss of time; I cannot think him
false.</p>
<h3>SCENE XVI.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia</span>, <span class="smcap">Lord
Touchwood</span>.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; My lord musing!</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; He has a quick invention, if this were
suddenly designed.&nbsp; Yet he says he had prepared my chaplain
already.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; Now I fear indeed.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Cynthia here!&nbsp; Alone, fair cousin, and
melancholy?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Your lordship was thoughtful.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; My thoughts were on serious business not
worth your hearing.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Mine were on treachery concerning you, and may be
worth your hearing.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Treachery concerning me?&nbsp; Pray be
plain.&nbsp; Hark!&nbsp; What noise?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; (within)&nbsp; Will you not hear me?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; (within)&nbsp; No, monster! traitor!&nbsp;
No.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; My lady and Maskwell!&nbsp; This may be
lucky.&nbsp; My lord, let me entreat you to stand behind this
screen and listen: perhaps this chance may give you proof of what
you ne&rsquo;er could have believed from my suspicions.</p>
<h3>SCENE XVII.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span> <i>with a
dagger</i>; <span class="smcap">Maskwell</span>; <span
class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lord
Touchwood</span> <i>abscond</i>, <i>listening</i>.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; You want but leisure to invent fresh
falsehood, and soothe me to a fond belief of all your fictions:
but I will stab the lie that&rsquo;s forming in your heart, and
save a sin, in pity to your soul.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Strike then, since you will have it so.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; A steady villain to the last.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Come, why do you dally with me thus?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Thy stubborn temper shocks me, and you knew
it would; this is cunning all, and not courage.&nbsp; No; I know
thee well, but thou shalt miss thy aim.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Do you mock my rage?&nbsp; Then
this shall punish your fond, rash contempt.&nbsp; Again
smile!&nbsp; [<i>Goes to strike</i>.]&nbsp; And such a smile as
speaks in ambiguity!&nbsp; Ten thousand meanings lurk in each
corner of that various face.</p>
<p>Oh! that they were written in thy heart,</p>
<p>That I, with this, might lay thee open to my sight!</p>
<p>But then &rsquo;twill be too late to know&mdash;</p>
<p>Thou hast, thou hast found the only way to turn my rage.&nbsp;
Too well thou knowest my jealous soul could never bear
uncertainty.&nbsp; Speak, then, and tell me.&nbsp; Yet are you
silent.&nbsp; Oh, I am wildered in all passions.&nbsp; But thus
my anger melts.&nbsp; [<i>Weeps</i>.]&nbsp; Here, take this
poniard, for my very spirits faint, and I want strength to hold
it; thou hast disarmed my soul.&nbsp; [<i>Gives the
dagger</i>.]</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Amazement shakes me.&nbsp; Where will this
end?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; So, &rsquo;tis well&mdash;let your wild fury have
a vent; and when you have temper, tell me.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Now, now, now I am calm and can hear
you.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Thanks, my invention; and
now I have it for you.&nbsp; First, tell me what urged you to
this violence: for your passion broke in such imperfect terms,
that yet I am to learn the cause.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; My lord himself surprised me with the news
you were to marry Cynthia, that you had owned our love to him,
and his indulgence would assist you to attain your ends.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; How, my lord?</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Pray forbear all resentments for a while,
and let us hear the rest.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I grant you in appearance all is true; I seemed
consenting to my lord&mdash;nay, transported with the
blessing.&nbsp; But could you think that I, who had been happy in
your loved embraces, could e&rsquo;er be fond of an inferior
slavery?</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Oh, poison to my ears!&nbsp; What
do I hear?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Nay, good my lord, forbear resentment; let us hear
it out.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Yes, I will contain, though I could
burst.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I, that had wantoned in the rich circle of your
world of love, could be confined within the puny province of a
girl?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Yet though I dote on each last favour more
than all the rest, though I would give a limb for every look you
cheaply throw away on any other object of your love: yet so far I
prize your pleasures o&rsquo;er my own, that all this seeming
plot that I have laid has been to gratify your taste and cheat
the world, to prove a faithful rogue to you.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; If this were true.&nbsp; But how can it
be?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I have so contrived that Mellefont will presently,
in the chaplain&rsquo;s habit, wait for Cynthia in your
dressing-room; but I have put the change upon her, that she may
be other where employed.&nbsp; Do you procure her night-gown, and
with your hoods tied over your face, meet him in her stead.&nbsp;
You may go privately by the back stairs, and, unperceived, there
you may propose to reinstate him in his uncle&rsquo;s favour, if
he&rsquo;ll comply with your desires&mdash;his case is desperate,
and I believe he&rsquo;ll yield to any conditions.&nbsp; If not
here, take this; you may employ it better than in the heart of
one who is nothing when not yours.&nbsp; [<i>Gives the
dagger</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Thou can&rsquo;st deceive everybody.&nbsp;
Nay, thou hast deceived me; but &rsquo;tis as I would wish.&nbsp;
Trusty villain!&nbsp; I could worship thee.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; No more; it wants but a few minutes of the time;
and Mellefont&rsquo;s love will carry him there before his
hour.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; I go, I fly, incomparable Maskwell!</p>
<h3>SCENE XVIII.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Maskwell</span>, <span
class="smcap">Cynthia</span>, <span class="smcap">Lord
Touchwood</span>.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; So, this was a pinch indeed, my invention was upon
the rack, and made discovery of her last plot.&nbsp; I hope
Cynthia and my chaplain will be ready; I&rsquo;ll prepare for the
expedition.</p>
<h3>SCENE XIX.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Lord Touchwood</span>.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Now, my lord?</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Astonishment binds up my rage!&nbsp;
Villainy upon villainy!&nbsp; Heavens, what a long track of dark
deceit has this discovered!&nbsp; I am confounded when I look
back, and want a clue to guide me through the various mazes of
unheard-of treachery.&nbsp; My wife!&nbsp; Damnation!&nbsp; My
hell!</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; My lord, have patience, and be sensible how great
our happiness is, that this discovery was not made too late.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I thank you, yet it may be still too late,
if we don&rsquo;t presently prevent the execution of their
plots;&mdash;ha, I&rsquo;ll do&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s
Mellefont, my poor injured nephew?&nbsp; How shall I make him
ample satisfaction?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I dare answer for him.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I do him fresh wrong to question his
forgiveness; for I know him to be all goodness.&nbsp; Yet my
wife!&nbsp; Damn her:&mdash;she&rsquo;ll think to meet him in
that dressing-room.&nbsp; Was&rsquo;t not so?&nbsp; And Maskwell
will expect you in the chaplain&rsquo;s chamber.&nbsp; For once,
I&rsquo;ll add my plot too:&mdash;let us haste to find out, and
inform my nephew; and do you, quickly as you can, bring all the
company into this gallery.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll expose the strumpet,
and the villain.</p>
<h3>SCENE XX.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Froth</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Sir Paul</span>.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; By heavens, I have slept an age.&nbsp; Sir
Paul, what o&rsquo;clock is&rsquo;t?&nbsp; Past eight, on my
conscience; my lady&rsquo;s is the most inviting couch, and a
slumber there is the prettiest amusement!&nbsp; But where&rsquo;s
all the company?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; The company, gads-bud, I don&rsquo;t know, my
lord, but here&rsquo;s the strangest revolution, all turned topsy
turvy; as I hope for providence.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; O heavens, what&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s my wife?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; All turned topsy turvy as sure as a gun.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; How do you mean?&nbsp; My wife?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; The strangest posture of affairs!</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; What, my wife?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; No, no, I mean the family.&nbsp; Your
lady&rsquo;s affairs may be in a very good posture; I saw her go
into the garden with Mr. Brisk.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Where, when, what to do?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; I suppose they have been laying their heads
together.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; How?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Nay, only about poetry, I suppose, my lord;
making couplets.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Couplets.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Oh, here they come.</p>
<h3>SCENE XXI.</h3>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Lady Froth</span>, <span
class="smcap">Brisk</span>.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; My lord, your humble servant; Sir Paul,
yours,&mdash;the finest night!</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; My dear, Mr. Brisk and I have been
star-gazing, I don&rsquo;t know how long.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Does it not tire your ladyship?&nbsp; Are not
you weary with looking up?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, no, I love it violently.&nbsp; My dear,
you&rsquo;re melancholy.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; No, my dear; I&rsquo;m but just awake.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Snuff some of my spirit of hartshorn.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve some of my own, thank you,
dear.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Well, I swear, Mr. Brisk, you understood
astronomy like an old Egyptian.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Not comparably to your ladyship; you are the very
Cynthia of the skies, and queen of stars.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s because I have no light but
what&rsquo;s by reflection from you, who are the sun.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Madam, you have eclipsed me quite, let me
perish.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t answer that.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; No matter.&nbsp; Hark &rsquo;ee, shall you
and I make an almanac together?</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; With all my soul.&nbsp; Your ladyship has made me
the man in&rsquo;t already, I&rsquo;m so full of the wounds which
you have given.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; O finely taken!&nbsp; I swear now you are
even with me.&nbsp; O Parnassus, you have an infinite deal of
wit.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; So he has, gads-bud, and so has your
ladyship.</p>
<h3>SCENE XXII.</h3>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Lady Plyant</span>, <span
class="smcap">Careless</span>, <span
class="smcap">Cynthia</span>.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; You tell me most surprising things; bless
me, who would ever trust a man?&nbsp; Oh my heart aches for fear
they should be all deceitful alike.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; You need not fear, madam, you have charms to fix
inconstancy itself.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; O dear, you make me blush.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Come, my dear, shall we take leave of my
lord and lady?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll wait upon your lordship
presently.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Mr. Brisk, my coach shall set you down.</p>
<p>ALL.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp; [<i>A great shriek
from the corner of the stage</i>.]</p>
<h3>SCENE XXIII.</h3>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span>
<i>runs out affrighted</i>, <i>my lord after her</i>, <i>like a
parson</i>.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;m betrayed.&nbsp; Save me, help
me!</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Now what evasion, strumpet?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Stand off, let me go.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Go, and thy own infamy pursue thee.&nbsp;
You stare as you were all amazed,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t wonder at
it,&mdash;but too soon you&rsquo;ll know mine, and that
woman&rsquo;s shame.</p>
<h3>SCENE the last.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Touchwood</span>, <span

Froth</span>, <span class="smcap">Lady Plyant</span>, <span

class="smcap">Maskwell</span>, <span
class="smcap">Mellefont</span> <i>disguised in a parson&rsquo;s
habit and pulling in</i> <span class="smcap">Maskwell</span>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Nay, by heaven you shall be seen.&nbsp; Careless,
your hand.&nbsp; Do you hold down your head?&nbsp; Yes, I am your
chaplain, look in the face of your injured friend; thou wonder of
all falsehood.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Are you silent, monster?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Good heavens!&nbsp; How I believed and loved this
man!&nbsp; Take him hence, for he&rsquo;s a disease to my
sight.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Secure that manifold villain.&nbsp;
[<i>Servants seize him</i>.]</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Miracle of ingratitude!</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; This is all very surprising, let me perish.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; You know I told you Saturn looked a little
more angry than usual.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll think of punishment at leisure,
but let me hasten to do justice in rewarding virtue and wronged
innocence.&nbsp; Nephew, I hope I have your pardon, and
Cynthia&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; We are your lordship&rsquo;s creatures.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; And be each other&rsquo;s comfort.&nbsp; Let
me join your hands.&nbsp; Unwearied nights, and wishing days
attend you both; mutual love, lasting health, and circling joys,
tread round each happy year of your long lives.</p>
<blockquote><p>Let secret villany from hence be warned;<br />
Howe&rsquo;er in private mischiefs are conceived,<br />
Torture and shame attend their open birth;<br />
Like vipers in the womb, base treachery lies,<br />
Still gnawing that, whence first it did arise;<br />
No sooner born, but the vile parent dies.</p>

<h2>EPILOGUE<br />
Spoken by <span class="smcap">Mrs. Mountford</span>.</h2>
<p>Could poets but foresee how plays would take,<br />
Then they could tell what epilogues to make;<br />
Whether to thank or blame their audience most.<br />
But that late knowledge does much hazard cost:<br />
Till dice are thrown, there&rsquo;s nothing won, nor lost.<br />
So, till the thief has stolen, he cannot know<br />
Whether he shall escape the law, or no.<br />
But poets run much greater hazards far<br />
Than they who stand their trials at the bar.<br />
The law provides a curb for it&rsquo;s own fury,<br />
And suffers judges to direct the jury:<br />
But in this court, what difference does appear!<br />
For every one&rsquo;s both judge and jury here;<br />
Nay, and what&rsquo;s worse, an executioner.<br />
All have a right and title to some part,<br />
Each choosing that in which he has most art.<br />
The dreadful men of learning all confound,<br />
Unless the fable&rsquo;s good, and moral sound.<br />
The vizor-masks, that are in pit and gallery,<br />
Approve, or damn, the repartee and raillery.<br />
The lady critics, who are better read,<br />
Inquire if characters are nicely bred;<br />
If the soft things are penned and spoke with grace;<br />
They judge of action too, and time, and place;<br />
In which we do not doubt but they&rsquo;re discerning,<br />
For that&rsquo;s a kind of assignation learning.<br />
Beaus judge of dress; the witlings judge of songs;<br />
The cuckoldom, of ancient right, to cits belongs.<br />
Thus poor poets the favour are denied<br />
Even to make exceptions, when they&rsquo;re tried.<br />
&rsquo;Tis hard that they must every one admit:<br />
Methinks I see some faces in the pit<br />
Which must of consequence be foes to wit.<br />
You who can judge, to sentence may proceed;<br />
But though he cannot write, let him be freed<br />
At least from their contempt who cannot read.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
